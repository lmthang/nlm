every time i see them , besides resentment , there is the feeling of being left with no alternatives in my heart ... simliar things always occur in china 's diplomacy in recent years .
in december 2011 , officers and workers from five units of jiangxi province prison system : nanchang prison , women 's prison , xin kang prison , juvenile offenders correctional facilitie , the judicial police vocational college , were brought together in succession by superiors of different ranking to learn about a policy notice " implementation measures on purchasing former nanchang prison and other land of xinjian county and construction of capped - price housing " .

recently i also noted that there is a micro - charity program called the " free lunch program , " which is very high-powered and of great impact on the internet , with big companies such as midea electric appliances and celebrities such as sun honglei also participating and calling upon it , it seems that it is winning more and more recognition and support from online charitable persons .
these cold figures enable the outside world to know more or less about the secret of the " three major public expenditures , " and understand why the fiscal revenue continuously hit a new record but the central budget is still tight .

then in the chaos not far away , i saw the back of someone being supported by the arms by several police , and left from the direction of the front of bus ,
the driver closed the door of the bus , the masses were safe , and the crowd on the sidelines grew and grew , more and more police came also ,
the police took some people involved --- such as the grandma who gave up her seat , the injured grandma , and several young men with bloodstains all over ......
the suspect just extended out his head , with his shoulder still in the window , some police grabbed him , and dragged him down , then pressed him to the earth , and put handcuffs and shackles on him , one of the police even stepped on him !
although a variety of safety precautions have been continuously taken since the emergence of modern means of transport , accidents are not prevented from occurring .
therefore , china 's high-speed railway should not be totally negated for a major railway accident , it is by no means a rational attitude to say the administrative organizations are in a mass and even condemn the society as being in disastrous state and a bundle of negatives .
but people do not know that major collision accidents also occurred on the railway with highest speed of 45 km per hour during the cultural revolution only because the people did not know major accidents that were regarded as state secrets and no one dare to say even if one knew in such political environment .

taiping island is 860 nautical miles away from taiwan , 330 nautical miles away from the coast of vietnam , and 440 nautical miles away from the subic naval base of the philippines . it is 270 nautical miles away from the palawan island of the philippines , and 410 nautical miles away from the xisha islands garrisoned by the pla .
unless the mainland uses aircraft carriers to control the south china sea , it will face the same plight as the taiwanese forces .
i think there is no need to send out the troops , it would be enough to solve the problem that the people of the whole country go piss there , then the sea level will rise and they would be drowned to death .
a rabid dog is constantly barking , but will be submissive if you beat it !
they have to explain to china why obama got married !
do n't pay attention to him at all . he has got more than a dozen aircraft carriers !
this is not the arabian nights .
there is no doubt , that the eu embarking on a political venture as a hero is another stimulus to the asean countries
thus it will make the south china sea situation develop irreversibly into a militarized confrontation .

you ca n't control what other people say . it 's really not easy to control what people want to say . but we must prepare well for this matter .
do not think about the development of one place . there is still no person of any country who can catch up to the chinese people .
the term corrupted kmt member is not a commendable one . hearing it , an ordinary person would feel horrified . and i also feel that i am not a good man .
but nato including the us has also figured out some points , and know that it is impossible for the two countries to cooperate with each other sincerely , so they dare to act boldly in disregard of everything else , the only consideration for them may be that the money in their purse is not enough .
the multipolar pattern is the most ideal , domination by one country is not a good thing internationally and domestically .
dictatorships will perish one by one . how can the remaining dictatorships not be worried ?
since the ' 70s of the last century , it has engaged in a long-range strike on the ugandan airport , a sudden attack on an iraqi nuclear reactor , a surprise raid on the bekaa valley 's the surface-to-air missile battery , a sneak attack on an egyptian airbase , a forceful attack on the suez canal behind the lines of the egyptian army , and so on , on up to the last year , when it without notice by gods or ghosts blew up a suspected nuclear reactor in syria ,
the united states enters asia , american challenges china , it 's basically not as simple as some elites think ;
i gave one answer to kill to death in the blog :
the polar bear is the most vicious thing . it not only occupies millions of square kilometers of chinese territory , but also reaches its evil claws to china 's south sea and to the southern asian region ...
only after myanmar took a series of actions , such as releasing political prisoners , releasing aung san suu kyi from house arrest , allowing the opposition party to participate in political affairs , sending its foreign minister to america on a secret visit to actively express goodwill , etc. , did obama 's " imperial countenance " become slightly relaxed and he agreed to let the secretary of state step on myanmar soil again after an interval of 50 years .
without exerting the strength to blow away dust or spending " a single penny , " obama had myanmar 's president on his knees .
north korea running to the united states for help is not a big deal ,
our generation totally cannot sell all and consume all , and totally has to leave a little something to our future generations ?
because if china in its capacity as a regional power does not even have , at a minimum , the ability to protect its little brother , then who will continue to have relations with china .
you should know that china can destroy south korea , but south korea cannot .
from my point of view , the iran issue needs support from russia , otherwise they will hit them and just keep hitting .
the disenfranchised know difficulties , while officials can only imprison and fool around .
the chinese government should dispatch special police forces , enter the golden triangle and eliminate the drug lords , it is a way to train the forces and show off national pride .
it is not worth refuting such cliches and extremely messy work
only an expert .
china exercised veto power at the security council twice , but no serious harm was done .
to resist foreign aggression , be sure to first get rid of the enemy within . this policy of chiang kai-shek still appears useful today
otherwise , our leader will become the 2nd qaddafi , and will be beaten to death , oh ?
sigh . a great country has raised a group of timid leaders
there wo n't be a fight , because the big countries do n't want to fight . there are n't any countries willing to lay down their lives for vietnam and the philippines .
the great motherland has come to the most critical moment ,
we chinese people are very realistic , some people are willing to be domestic slaves , others are willing to pursue democracy and freedom , so some people are willing to resist those who aggress their homeland , others are willing to offer their wives to live with aggressors ,
although the united states does not find evidence that saddam possesses weapons of mass destruction , even some specious or chase the wind and clutch at shadows evidence ,
regardless of parties , they will be disclosed by the opponents in case of poor performance , the people can criticize as much as possible , the media can supervise , the people can give their votes to the party safeguarding their own interests ,
the japanese think that they might wake up one day and be completely swallowed up by the pacific ocean .
the so-called wealth and power are just the things with which some brain-dead people deceive themselves and others
america has announced that it will provide to taiwan an arms sales plan totaling 5.852 billion usd , but it has withdrawn from the originally planned sales of f16c/d fighter planes , and will instead implement technological upgrading of taiwan 's existing f16a/b fighter planes .
the air force power parity sought by taiwan back then has already been broken as time passed by .
according to taiwanese leaders ' principle of equal power in negotiations , this kind of situation of an enormous military gap is not allowed to happen .
another vision of the taiwanese air force is to seek superiority in an air war over the taiwan strait , but this is similarly limited by its strategic depth .
with its missile superiority , china can promptly destroy the airfields and alternative landing fields on taiwan island , and no matter how advanced taiwan 's fighter planes may be , they will either become rubbish after the attack or , if they are lucky enough to escape , will have no place to land or refuel .
if the present situation cannot be changed , then taiwan 's current plan for arms purchases is only a strategy aimed at psychological comfort .
look . obama went to see the dalai lama again
do not use a point to cover a surface , and china 's progress is obvious to all .
we do n't want to do military exercises with russians , not due to reasons cited by the thread starter , but because we do n't need to haphazardly take up arms at our own doorstep !
more than ten of our fellow countrymen buried themselves in the stomach of fish !
i think it 's had enough .
no china 's territory should be split .
us termination of arms sales to taiwan will come soon ...
however , under powerful air attacks by the united states , they could only go on the defensive and found it extremely difficult to even encircle and annihilate one u.s. army division .
public servants , monopoly state-owned enterprise employees , professors , and experts , they actually have the time
i guess now the u.s. military does not dare to fire its missiles randomly anymore because many of our missiles and airplanes have made their appearance .
the so-called military " experts " led by zhang shaozhong are actually some fraudsters ,
do not dare to speak the truth and not allowed to speak the truth , these are the inherent weaknesses of our people !
and in this situation china will certainly not rush to use military force against foreign countries , and the us will certainly not acquiesce to china 's political rise and military empowerment .
when did the chinese people resist u.s. aggression and aid korea ? what kind of situation was china in ?
but this writer believes that america 's talk about feeling wronged is worth deep consideration , i do n't really believe that after spending eight years to conquer iraq , the american and british allied forces will let china sit back and enjoy the benefits .
recently , the philippines that often makes provocations at the south china sea actually gave in . there must be some extremely important reasons behind its submission ,
the south china sea is not only an extremely important strategic place , but even more important as a strategic transportation line and lifeline ,
according to the current performance data , the performance of china 's major equipment , the latest type 96 , type 98 , and type 99 tanks ( hereinafter abbreviated to type 9x tanks ) , is close to that of russia 's t-80 and t-90 tanks .
in reality , after this unit was under the targeted elimination , all the cellphones and vehicle remote controls of platoon - level to company - level officers to high ranking brigade-level officers were tightly monitored . as soon as signals from these targets appeared , missiles would be fired to eliminate them .
hence , the camouflaged chinese fishing boat and spy ship mentioned in the news at the beginning of this article , is a regional response to the us increasing its military strength in the straits of malacca .
there will definitely be many obstacles along the road of china 's development .
and it was also said that south korean soldiers shot at an airliner several times but missed it
that is to say , we do n't even know what kind of thing we will rebuild this " non - mule non - horse " into .
it turns out the " three represents " has guided the construction of male carriers , such that the aircraft carriers dare not come out .
for a new thing , crossing the river by feeling the stones and exploring are understandable .
some sources claim that 20 warships have already gathered at the chinese naval base on south sea island . all of them are the elite warships of the three big fleets . this is a major move by the pla .
in terms of warfare aptitude and strength , vietnam is the most powerful among the south asian countries , it can also be said that crushing vietnam the monkey chief can achieve a huge deterrent effect ,
the sea is not like the mountainous area . as long as our whip is long enough , it will be recovered sooner or later , only the soldiers today are too timid and need a few years of training !
relying on blocking and prodding will certainly change things in the end . this is what gaddafi 's name means !
go to the us , and let them exploit you !
making several more aircraft carriers -- people wanting money not face , crazy corruption at all levels , what sovereignty , dignity , or backbone , are all setting aside disputes ! are n't they still just piles of scrap metal !
keep a low profile , it has n't changed for a hundred years . weapons are wielded by people , if the mind has no sword spirit and the general public 's strong support , even if you possess 20 aircraft carriers , they 're just a kind of decoration .
during the qing dynasty , the court became corrupt and the eight - nation alliance invaded china and attempted to carve up china , at that time the old woman were conducting the government people were weak and goods were not good , today ....
and who traded territory for peace in the modern history of china ?
the united states claims it has tangible interests globally , and thus it has deployed a global naval force , with aircraft carriers as the core of the naval combat capabilities , which gives rise to the famous rhetoric " wherever there are us interests , there are us carriers . "
my humble self is a virgo girl , people always say i am obsessed with cleanliness , but i really do think that the surrounding environment is as dirty and messy as it could be , and that people 's hygienic habits are extremely bad !

i had never known there actually was such a " get rich " approach , but after i saw more truth revealed by the industry in the xiaohan search store , i want to ask , can human beings still live with dignity now ?
later , i saw a lot of various analyses by calm people on netease microblogs , and they made a lot of sense .
first , its decision-making managers ' heads were dazzled by the joy of success , so that they ignored the further consolidation and expansion of the market ,
if wal-mart continues to go their own way like this , i think its fading out of china should be just a matter of time !
this little wadded jacket is thin and weak , and considering mom 's requirements and the actual conditions , my standard for choosing a house goes as follows :
the chief reason ? is because there is a little garden opposite to the balcony of the main bedroom ; mom likes sunning clothes .
specifically what kind of inside information is there ? for the simplest example , let 's talk about the issue of money , with which everyone is most concerned . once at a meeting , i clearly remember our network top manager saying something like this : as long as you thoroughly understand business negotiations , the industry wo n't pay you one cent less . at that time , i got very angry because i really hate hearing these kinds of things .
they also said that you could get 456 yuan even before there are two directors at the lower line , but those who have worked in other cities all know , is this possible ?
what do you mean housing prices dropped
it is not that the government is not aware , but that it has n't solve this problem systematically , it just knows to be practical , follow suit , we do n't need data , we need to solve the problem systematically .
try to ask which developers in china began to build houses without the participation of banks , whether you are central enterprises or private companies .

these various signs can not help but make people feel that the tax department levies taxes sticking a pin wherever there 's room ; whatever they are able to find a reason to levy a tax on , whatever it is will have a tax levied on it , and also the speed of reaction will happen so fast that it makes people have to sigh , and not dare to slack a little bit .
however , in an obvious contrast with this , is that in terms of tax cuts , the related departments then pretend to be deaf and mute , with one eye open and the other closed , and collect taxes in the same old way from the people who do n't know the real facts , and also do n't take the initiative in reminding them .
on this point , we can make a calculation : right now the average monthly income for people in shenzhen , guangzhou , shanghai , and beijing is around 4,000 yuan , and a family 's income is around 8,000 yuan . assuming that this family uses 50 % of its monthly income to purchase a house , then every month it can take out 4,000 , and in one year that 's not even 50,000 .
despite the fact that foreigners see it as a joke , we have quite a few people who are extremely proud of this . if this is not a social shackle , what is it ?
to be able to work at such a corporation would definitely be prestigious .

deng xiaoping once proposed : " we must have products in hand , we must have our own famous brands , or else we will be bullied by others . "
i think it 's very worth it that a little money can buy some security
in fact this is a lack of confidence in ourselves , if it has state-of-the-art arms , it will also hold a tough attitude to safeguard sovereignty in the south china sea , which is a deterrence to surrounding countries .
cnn commented , saying nato currently not only wants to kick gadhafi out of office , they also have a new mission : eliminate gadhafi .
it 's messing up the middle east because the u.s. wants to let the forces in middle east get re - shuffled again , and weaken the european union and russia and to strengthen its position in the middle east ,
we must endeavor again and again , take hold of our strengths and supplement our deficiencies , continuously making breakthroughs , continuously improving the construction craft of our country 's aircraft carrier battle group , and continuously improve the maintain skills and operational skills of our country 's aircraft carrier battle group , and continuously improve the combat effectiveness of our country 's aircraft carrier battle group !
aircraft carriers are very important , but there are also many fatal flaws , where is its path of development ?
the issue over the south china sea is not an occasional occurrence this year , but rather it dates back to a long time ago .
only when seeing the combat capability of the troops , however , did mullen understand that if taiwan declares independence , china will liberate taiwan with ease and none could dispatch troops to approach and intervene in the taiwan strait .
i think that china should fight back the philippines in the following ways !
china really has no solutions ! ! ! ! ! !!!
to solve it now , china may gain even less ....
we actually want to ask what is it that japan wants .
if there 's no soy sauce , then buy a bag of salt
everyone already knows the reasons you have put forth . why ?
time does not wait for one . china should not again miss the chance to join hand with countries that are strongly against the united states . otherwise , in this world , except for north korea , there is no alliance country that can help china in its wars .
from gaddafi 's perspective , the more his enemies fear something , that is exactly what he must use his utmost strength to do ; it could be said in a certain sense , if gaddafi can preserve his strength early on , and then gradually eliminate the coalition " vital forces " in an effective manner , which would be a huge blow to the coalition forces ' will to fight , until the coalition forces retreat .
gaddafi the autocrat is finished , nobody can rescue him .
it is a " tragedy . " one hundred years later , in the new world with resource allocation and a situation where there are powerful and weak countries , the united states , the united kingdom , and france cannot resist but often use ** excuses to commit shameless acts and rob the resources of other countries .
should we conduct one nuclear test or more ?
if gaddafi does n't step down , from where can nato reap benefits ? without benefits , would n't the previous air attacks become loss-making deals , and who would have agreed to it ?
previous wars prove that relying on air attacks alone wo n't solve any problems . iraq , the federal republic of yugoslavia , and afghanistan are all very good examples . in the end , only ground war can be relied upon for solving problems or being able to obtain benefits .
third , in order to reach some military , political , and economic goals , it sowed political discord between certain emerging countries and some european countries that are leading the war .
like cuba , hold peaceful political reform under the auspices of gaddafi !
ally with the us?? ? cede a few of the south china sea islands to the us , or give the us some land and sea territory to build military bases and moor warships !
we chinese people see very clearly what stuff the us is .
do you know what ah q means ?
i wonder if hillary , who is " well-versed " in the chinese culture and talks non-stop about " when you are in the same boat you have to row in the same direction , " has even heard of the saying : " a gentleman seeks for what he wants in himself ; a villain seeks for it from others ? "
the us , upon observing current problems of china , says they are going to destroy chinese finance , that 's blow the cow , sticking gold on themselves ,
that is to say , if china does n't utilize military force with its courage aroused at the first drum beat , it will be impossible to recover all the islands -- other than this there is no other way to do it .
we do n't know how many cheng yaojins popping in halfway down the road will there be ?
and the country is not able to come up with a good means to solve the problem of each local government using various methods to covertly plunder the wealth of the people ,

( bin ge ) india exercises its power in africa , vows to contend with china !
and the african continent is considered by many economists to be a region whose economy will grow rapidly in the coming decades -- it can be said that most african markets are still in the virgin stage , waiting to begin .
it was using psychological warfare . it was virtually telling people that its nuclear weapons are false . nuclear weapons are such a serious issue . do n't you feel this is very funny ?
i always thought that what the us bombed that year was japan 's main integrated backup ammunition depot ( including chemical weapons , etc ) , and the huge explosive power produced was deified as the atomic bomb . and this kind of propaganda war was used by the western countries all along during the second world war ,
in the beginning , xu you urged him to get rid of cao cao , but he refused to do so . he was indecisive and missed good opportunities , saying he wanted to wait till he was a bit more powerful .
then , hold anti - intervention exercises in coordination with the eleven warships from the east , this kind of scale will make vietnam 's missile boat exercises suffer by comparison and will completely nullify its advantage of holding exercises first . at the same time , it will strike the fear into vietnam at the first encounter .
since vietnam started wielding its power first , and since we have the ability to secure victory , i still suggest that our government completely change its previous way of handling this issue and unleash china 's military might through fighting .
" there can never be too much deception in war " is one of the thirty-six strategies , but we should n't abuse this " there can never be too much deception in war " strategy . do n't forget that we are a big country with a population of 1.3 billion ; the earth will tremble once we mobilize .
if any conflicts arise , they will just be too short to produce a " " full-scale " war , but can be used to make an example . we 'll see what the westerners will do about it . this would be better than waiting until something goes wrong with changes in the taiwan straits .
they do not have the ability to administer the state .
moreover , it is the flashy without substance show style of the taiwanese politicians . the inherent pragmatic style is lost .
vietnam believes that it is holding china 's main economic artery due to its geographical advantages .
in a situation where the air force does not have air supremacy ; these boats are basically the live targets of our " flying leopards " and h-6s .
with no support from early-warning aircrafts , if they fight with the chinese air force that outnumbers them , what are their chances of survival ? after they lose the air strength , will vietnam 's navy dare to go out without underwater and air defense strength ?
they use the army to fight a war . we use the words of the group of so-called " diplomats " of our ministry of foreign affairs to fight the war .
vietnam is a country with a long and narrow territory , a country with no strategic depth , we can directly choke it off economically , can choke off its water resources , and can also split off its northern territories .
slowly kill off its economic development , divide the country internally , and then this country will certainly perish , do you think it will still have the energy to come grab the spratly islands ?
this saying is in itself a lie , ca n't believe you fell for it , go and read the great qin empire , what does it matter to cede a few city moats to opponents when your own muscles are not strong enough ?
will the first shot be fired only after our country 's south china sea territorial waters have all been occupied .
first of all , let me despise the subways of guangzhou , which are too damn crowded .
i asked him what he was shooting for ! to upload to a microblog with unicom red microblogging !
at night , getting on the microblog , i really saw the microblogged video that the guy next door shot -- he really shot it and uploaded it to the microblog .

since apple computer , inc. was established in 1976 , jobs had led his team to launch electronic products popular around the world , including imac , ipod , iphone and ipad .
do n't think what we did was any illegal business .
the key is to see whether you can grasp the future market development trends , and also it is to discover something confidential or hidden .
as the saying is , " you may not make a deal for three years , but a concluded deal may be enough to sustain you for three years " , which refers to this trade of ours . actually , many hot websites now in the market all went out from our hands . so we still have some experience .
because the domain name business has not been good in recent years , many customers are n't willing to spend too much money in this . they 'd rather step back and request a second choice , a slightly poorer domain name , and then promote and make up it by advertising .
on the afternoon of the same day , the buyer 's party checked into a four-star hotel near us after arriving .
we simply dared not believe this kind of efficiency . we all felt that this should be a " big fish . " someone said tencent intends to comprehensively advance into the e-commerce business ; others also said that apple inc. intends to open up its own online direct marketing .
seeing such results , are n't you very proud to be chinese ?
at present , mainstream configurations of android mobile phones on the market can already operate wii games smoothly .

you ordinary people are just being taken for a ride , when you reflect a problem , they say you are a trouble - maker , restless , it seems that it 's still better to become an official
> we need to respond to the call of leadership , regarding his highness the department director who joined the army at 13 years old ; we need to begin an inclusive political process ; ; making a contribution for a harmonious society
compared to a few years ago , the civil service examination has made big progress , which makes me and others see hope in the area of fairness , transparency , etc. of course there is the phenomenon of " radish pit " in some places ; against this , we should increase transparency and promote fairness through transparency .
facing the blatantly overbearing rules , the first time , i felt so weak in front of these departments -

in the 1990s , beijing on the side of the mainland once launched a war for the taiwan straits in order to recover taiwan . the result was that both sides did n't get a satisfactory result .
once our economic development is better than that of taiwan 's , and our democratic development is better than that of taiwan 's , the green camp in taiwan will be moved and their attention attracted . and they would be willing to return to the mainland and support the reunification .
taiwan should focus on economic development , and it is not suitable for it to counteract by means of force .

if russia toppled by u.s. again this time , china can only fight against russia .
it 's hard to tell who 's going to topple by whom yet , i do n't care , i care about how long china 's peaceful developmental opportunity period can last !
it does not matter who wins russia or usa . the opportunities in peace are in count down mode .
you need to check on some information . what concept is 14 million square kilometers territory ?
such is blessing !
it seems the united states and russia have started a contest again . at the present , it is a great opportunity for china and russia to join their forces to cope with the united states . let 's see how much strength of the united states is left to stir up trouble in south china sea !
support russia , then benefits myself , comforted also !
hard to have real movements !
presently is it russian bear swallows american eagle , or american eagle swallows russian bear ?
if not support russia , then china is in danger !
i think so as well .
therefore , china and russia cooperate now can make three powerful countries co-exist .

one divided into two , each is different , some people think it 's a blessing , some people think it 's a curse .
to achieve , how much of america 's national interests were lost in middle east ?
if it is indeed premeditated
whether it is a blessing or a curse to china depends on the intelligence of the group of chinese leaders
still there is an allusion that one sleeps on brushwood and tastes gall
this conspiracy is so great , the us is struggling with its debt problems , but china is developing steadily and peacefully , very very good !
they just made a lie to attack iraq , is n't it stupid ?
right now , the us rather than staying humble , instead is continuing its insane course . therefore they interfere with the internal affairs of russian , wrangle with russia ( is n't it foolish? ) . is n't that a blessing for china ?

report from the people 's net : china will form armed security forces to escort the traffic of mekong ( a total of 1000 people )
in order to take the responsibility of a great country , china needs to immediately control the navigation right of the mekong river , mobilize warships and water police and so on , to maintain regular commercial navigation and the economic and safety interests of people in the neighboring countries .
collaborative patrol and law enforcement can guarantee the safety of the mekong river , support !
as expected , news on the 5th , iranian military shot down a surveillance unmanned aerial vehicle from the united states of the model rq170
source : fenghuang tv . font size : t t 1 person participated 0 comments print forward
according to the report , the model of the shot - down aircraft was us military surveillance unmanned aerial vehicle rq-170
rq-170 unmanned aircraft is mainly used for spying , it does not carry weapons
a statement made by the nato allies stationed in afghanistan says the airplane is suspected to be an american one that lost contact last week while flying over the western part of afghanistan
i think iran will make a big deal out of this incident .
otherwise why would i let everyone pay attention to the iranian sky and see what change there would be .
china should side with iran , form an alliance to constrain america .
the real talented geniuses are lay people , they usually will not ask about politics .
i believe the unmanned airport is spying on iran secretly , and it does go into iran from the east to the west , but we do n't exclude the possibility that it gets lost .
a couple days ago , us denied that their unmanned aircraft was shot down by iran . only until the night of the 6th at 23:50 , us finally admitted . it means my reply on the 3rd floor is correct .
i think , u.s. unmanned aerial vehicle indeed got shot over the iran sky then crushed , however did not crush on its own , it 's just that u.s. denied it got shot .
on the 8th , some western media claimed : u.s. unmanned aerial vehicle was forced to land due to interference of russia electronic control monitor .
if iran files complaint to the united nation regarding us surveillance unmanned aerial vehicles collecting information in iran , the united states will definitely be in a passive position
will the united states be ashamed into anger ?
it is not called shot down
i already mentioned in the 13th post that i agree the statement regarding the forced emergency landing by interference , similar with what you said about capture or arrest .
this is not exactly the same with forced emergency landing by interference
this kind of capture is countermeasure side grabbed control power to the target .
america invested so much . if it is such a result you can imagine its loss .
good analysis .
thinking to control russia 's government it all comes to nothing !
protect china !

hope there really will be a saint appear and save china .
only saving those people from shallow water and warm fire , only will china be saved .

in chinese history , there are three public recognized saints .
looking from chinese history , one sage appears approximately two thousand one hundred to two thousand six hundred years , or say it is a cycle .
no sage appearance , ten thousand anciently long nights !

if there is no birth of sage , ten thousand history would seem like long dark nights !
act but not argue , can only be on those matters that are non-controversial and have reached a consensus , controversies cannot be acted on !

men have a range of emotions , are entirely emotional animals .
man exhibit selfishness when treating self and family , almost no one can avoid the emotional side , unless man is not man anymore .
think about it who dares to be a person like this .
the so-called rationality is in in fact the feeling we have after we suffer from shame or adversity in the process of life .
sensitivity is the patent of very small group of people who suffered life 's pressure and thought through deeply and carefully .
those who are selfish become more and more selfish , and those who used to be selfless become selfish too , just as a sharp stone , washed and polished by water and time , lost its sharp edges and turned round .
it 's just that with those factors on the outside , these aspects have not made an appearance .
therefore , i 'm a materialist , quite rational .
however , naturally cold-blooded made me realize , being rational has the ultimate advantage !
reply to post #3 . you said well . it looks like you are not hypocritical . that will let other people look at you differently .
to reply the 6th post , of course the people who fought and died in the chinese civil war did not fall in vain , because they have secured the interest of all their families and offsprings
but we need to pay our debt to them forever !
just because the westerners see these human weaknesses more clearly , they could create a more plausible and complete law system , so they have the lowest corruption crime rate , and we are the opposite !
i think it is boring talking about fairness and democracy all the time .
it seems fair superficially , but in fact it is extremely unfair !
everyone has motivations , confidence and expectations
talking over their heads , doing nothing and aiming too high
advocacy of rationality will make a people strong
when they were dying did they have the thought in their minds that because they were protecting the rights of all their families and descendants ?
their deaths were for liberating our entire race , for the undertakings of socialism , they had no selfishness , and yet you accuse them of turning china into a capitalistic country , are n't you ashamed of yourself ?
that 's because you misunderstand rich people , rich people are not necessarily second generation officials , not people who gain without effort .
but you just wo n't look carefully .
but poor people must be indolent .
because they create wealth by labor
in your mind , people who go with you to support capitalism are people , opposing then are dogs .
idiotic thing !
is democracy a patent of capitalism ?
yes , before it seemed that you have been defining the difference between the poor and the rich all the time . now it seems that you are indeed the rich , a rich person spiritually !

in reply to post #23 , the consequence of this system is that there are local tyrants everywhere

understanding the true features of humanity is the primary thing to make rules of our regular society
those with morality are human ; prostitutes and whoremasters are animals
sensibility is the human nature . other animals also have sensibility . regarding this animals and human are not different .
the original poster 's wisdom , hope the original poster investigate further on the human selfishness , demystifying for the whole humanity .
this is determined by human intelligence / wisdom!
to reply the 58th post , this is my lifelong wish !
await for your grand entrance !
every man has emotions and desires , so not any man is perfect .
because if the original authenticity of humanity is lost , actually it will be the start of mistakes made by human
mankind 's blandly worshiping and believing digs a hole for mankind self and bury mankind in it eventually .
people tend to feel strong sympathy and understanding toward people who have had the same or similar experiences as them .
this is basically why those who have never suffered do not have any kindness or sympathy !
the reason why those rich second generation or powerful second generation are so arrogant and despotic is actually not hard to understand at all .
i feel ca n't generalize towards mankind 's selfishness , she the nature allowed mankind to dominate , ca n't downplay her importance . however , has it reached the end , days ca n't travel any further ?
responding to post #76 , correcting post #76 , these are all caused by human instincts , of course we are animals !
responding to post #77 , men at birth are naturally good !
human desire has no limit , thus human beings can never be satisfied .
in addition , chinese people are so eager to exploit the potential of their own reproductive systems , the population growth is prepared for a new wave of climax
the human instinct cannot be avoided , but human knows more about adapting to the changes in the surrounding environments
inside humanity there is a kind side , these actually are people , to one 's own experiences
it actually is just that people without any hardships have absolutely no kindness and sympathy .

hostile forces are very crafty . they send a crowd of corrupted officials to china and swept away countless wealth of the chinese people .
when red songs are singing evils have not place to hide .
they only claim to their supervisors and never publicize . how many problems will be pushed under cover ?
today i have not corrupted yet ,
to sing should sing the reddest song .
maintain a stable and harmonious society punish corrupt officials
is this still human ?
i saw this while using baidu.com to search for aristotle quotes , does everyone think it makes sense ?
this is a great progress , congratulations !
maybe this is as simple as it can be , but when i am doing good deeds , i have peace of mind , when i am doing bad things , i feel so guilty and comfortable .
is it cursing words to greet your family ?
is it supposedly honest words that is never sincere ?
then scientific advancement
i was going to make slanderous marks on the accomplishments of the leaders !
present day scientific advances , world class comparison
using words inappropriately , science should be changed to scientific skills .
we also had lived the grand tang golden age !
what 's the population of japan ?
maybe , the gap between the us and china is shrinking .
some say 50 years ?
because our politics does not have integrity as america 's does and we do n't have america 's democracy .
for example , workers and capitalist company owners do n't get along . there are disputes among them .
south china sea is the imaginary focal point .
shaohua is right .
what do you want to do by transplanting a flower to a wood , exchanging beam with post , and picking a piece from the whole ?
it certainly is romance movies . when we have all kinds of new forms of love , do we really believe love more from it ?
when we are doing seemingly romantic things , is the one by our side your temporary , or your true love ?
does love equal flooding ?
is love step by step ?
do you really believe there is love ?
when those kids who are still fledglings are courting each other , i feel that there should not be love inside it .
is that the love you think of at the beginning or after experiences
when love is flooded like that and when we treat love to its lowest point do we still know what love is ?
sex , love , marriage , what is the difference ?
have we truely thought about it for each other ?
the precious thing about love is that it enables us to get close someone whom you can bind with .
lovemaking can indeed deepen each other 's feelings , but if mutual psychology is not mutual , then !
a sexy society ...
marriage is not for having kids , because right now a few people still find kids troublesome .
in china , everything serves leaders . everything depends on leaders . every achievement should be shared with leaders
therefore it is said : if a leader sets an example , it will be followed by his subordinates
by the way it seems that i only wanted to explain the nature of romance , and did not say sex and romance oh !
ulterior motives !
are you a victim on this aspect ?
reply 17th post above .
it does not include sexual intercourse .
there is a bright side of it ?
the growth of the economy is to cultivate the culture and refine the technology
sex techniques must be developed by sex addicts !
the enlightened one must be a hallucinative master
enlightenment needs !
the most important thing here is : it needs a great amount of time , psycholagny requires great strength and thriving energy ! ...
only by having a good foundation , can we realize tao , realize tao , wild inside , mental masturbation
one should return the favor of a drop of water by a fountain of water
too promiscuous , damaged health , energy , and time ?
maybe can blaze a new trail !
in case succeed
can a case of peng yu prove that you must pay a cost for helping others ?
can a misjudged case prove we do n't have law ?
we are looking for excuses ?
do something that is within the reach of our hands , can we raise our noble hands ?
it happened that little plate had no activities . when seeing me shrinking alone at home , he entered and talked to me about the six kingdoms
the story line , started after shiaode 's second older sister passed away !
wishing mr . feitian will continue telling the story .
it seems people ere are all good bosses
only like to discuss useless politics
the malformed american policies planted the current awkward situation .
hi-tech american enterprises
is it still a major market economy country ?
the finance of the united states will be even harder
the big market of local demand in china
at that time , let 's look at the united states
how did you make it so good looking ?
i do n't get what you mean , but i known
but how many workers at foxconn china will be unemployed ?
greetings , brother artillery
the chinese market has tenacious vitality
this is exactly an alarming problem , how can it be used to show off ?
it 's our shortcomings that are worrisome
indeed need them to sell the technology
advanced technology achievements
originally farmers plow manually
now use machines
originally workers have to use hammer and chisel
completely automatic mechanical manipulation
the creator of that scientific research achievement
blockade of advanced technologies
is a narrow and selfish behavior
why do you have to be able to use the technologies developed by other people ?
if others do n't want to give or sell it makes sense too , how is it an abnormal state of mind ?
how would you think so .
how could they get themselves in this famine ?
take the picture home and try to appreciate it
people cannot figure it out
those living upstairs , just delivery these to my home
who cleaned the garbage at the end
deformed mindset
not for employment
everyone is drunk whereas you are sober
1 . local demand is weak , with a rich country and poor people , how can one talk about stuff like the market having tenacious vitality
perhaps not enough motivation to work so hard
thanks for support from the previous poster
i seem not to want to mention him
since july 2 , 2005 , rmb began appreciation compared to u.s. dollar .
china to u.s. 's trade is favorable .
all the way rose to two to three hundred billion usd .
u.s. financial deficit disease .
and also government officials ' lofty salary
wars , subversion expenses
the us government , always covering up its own flaws , and wreaking havoc in the world for this purpose
then let 's wait and see who will have a more difficult time maintaining stability
they dragged their morbid psyche
psychological sickness
depreciated rmb
swallowing tears to standing up
rmb will automatically appreciate
almost there
the american principle of profit first is deeply rooted in every individual !

comes down to it , class based society 's world view , value , life outlook are so called fame , fortune , wealth , thus does n't matter how to embellish still is vanity and fame wealth .
all fraudulently gaining fame by deceiving the public , ought to move towards the opposite / dark side .
the existence of class society is nobody have a real way out , no real joy and happiness at all .
they do not wish to explore the real truth of human society , even if truth is there they wo n't be able to hear it because of their views of the world , values , and life . it will be too hard for them to accept and understand .
the nazis are notables who spread invasions , who are able to make the germans big landlords , big capitalists , reigning over the inferior race .
what is poverty ?
what is the way out ?
the one who yells in pain is not property speculators
economy obeys the culture
this is the meaning of a person 's living . it 's also the meaning of a country to exist . further , it 's the necessecity for a nationality to contiue !
are you lao wu or youyou ?
at first political reform adapts , and then state owned enterprise compete with de-monopolization , and finally welfare equality eliminates excessive savings
doing data is not transition .
speaking about industry upgrading , no need to mention about employing branding and high tech
all like this , i 'd say doing it immediately will still have to wait after twenty years maybe
how do you get into technologies without talents , why get into industry upgrade ?
just purchased a house , but i still earnestly wish house pricing will slump .

on the other hand , the old generation has experienced a lot . it 's graved in their hearts .
english invasion and western ideological trend have dominanted for too long .
fenghuang critiques . russia plundered 14 million square kilometers of territories from us . why did the expects say nothing about it
in this contemporary era , in asia , all countries or regions that had experienced autocratical systems are the same such as , japan , taiwan , south korea , singapore , etc. it looks like they all have this tendency .
how do you control ?

youth although have an open mind , but do not have thoughts , just like trying to fly high in the sky without growing wings
hehe , young and innocent
that 's right . youth have little experience , but youth are the hope and future of a country !
because new era has new contraversies , the old tunes of landlords , rich peasants , counterrevolutionaries and bad guys is not working .
russia should be open for thirty years , corrupt young people .
young people are n't satisfied , because young people understand this person 's ability .
in my childhood , i once heard of the stories about why the pioneer true saints and great masters can be the pioneers
what rules have the chinese three high ministers / six boards / nine ministers and other officials followed in their entire lives ?
is the destruction of humanities
the origin history of chinese humanities
because of all branches of cultures in the world / entire human race , nothing indeed has the same as chinese culture
the future chinese status is not
role model
the human civilization and culture
should be what kind of figures
prophets , saints , wise men , able men and so on
therefore , in a culture with a long history , its prophets and saints are most believable
are just the representations of the crystals of human prophets
tools , carrier , hallows
first explore the limit of the known truth of human beings , indirect principles great achievers
on the predisposition and basis of this , only then true prophet and pioneer will be made , only then we can discern and determine the multitude of pseudo sciences
all represent the achievements of human pioneers
prophets / foregoer/forthgoer and so on
generations of china 's prophets / foregoer/forthgoer
ignorance makes one fearless . ignorance makes one superstitious . ignorance makes one benighted . ignorance makes one reckless .
emperor engaged in private lessons is fake and wicked emperor , other government officials engaged in private lessons must be killed with their families and entire clans .
all scholars must first accept all related strict rules !
to become an official , must first accept related strict rules !
another seems so but not really fake titled news is being disseminated ( office )
wo n't be seen as class oppression ?
what difference there is compare this ( communism ) with ill-gotten wealth .
power first , government officials first , party member first ,
which monster
privately learned fake product .
emperor setting side rules
other officers doing selfish study
officials and educators hook up , officials and educators incest , officials and educators disturb and false report etc
most tabooed , biggest enemy , most criminalized and evil comitting
this is morals and legal ethics , or
this is life .
it can create true prophets , trailblazers , pioneer , etc. it can recognize and judge a lot of false science , technology , and some others .
in cultures with a long history , their prophets and saints are most believable
confucius is the third in the chinese nation , but the top in the world
, how could there be

all kinds of , various shapes and flavors of crazy foreigners , did all your innovation , perfection , and invention of science appeared out of thin air ?
19 . abandoning wisdom , people benefit hundreds of time , abandoning integrity , people become more respectful towards elders , abandoning shortcuts and profiting , bandits disappear
look at sage and technocrat giant 's learned strict rules !
in addition to strictly abiding by the contemporary law ( real laws but not fake legal provisions ) , they had to add strict ownership place regulation , administration and supervision
they need to strictly follow the legal regulations and the inspection and management of the local government where they live .
those people are true prophets , forerunners , and pioneers .
one has to strictly obey the principles , indirect truth and scientific inventions and prophets
phony marxists rule everything
international businessmen rule everything . these totally are completely separating , deteriorating and destroying the chinese nation
all private schools of thoughts that are all rebellious , calamitous and humiliating to the country , which are all the evidence of their sins , will definitely leave a bad reputation for ten thousand years
ill - founded abnormal thinking
all of this civilized fields have been always like the way they were for thousands of years with no progress !
to be a emperor , one first needs to learn why and how to be an emperor
to be an official , one first needs to learn why and how to be an official
in order to be a merchant one must first embark on the way of the merchant and law of the merchant
in order to be a teacher one must first embark on the way of the teacher and law of the teacher
in order to be a subject one must first embark on the way of the subject and law of the subject
the way and law give everything .
constitution and law are first .
unknowledgeable superstitious , faith illness , thoughts illness , consciousness illness etc subjective control that completely derailed from objective reality
is modern times
map oppose righteous religion .
been ill transformed to
the even bigger human caused disaster !
these are realistic
all private studies , are only historical guilty evidence .
the feudalism doctrine , feudalism rule , feudalism principle
the ancestor of the principle of integration and differentiation in math
now it can be concluded as
speaking about forefathers , better to say the synthesis of ancient civilization , man as a individual in society is complicated after all .
cultural development cannot get away from the promotion and restriction by the historical conditions ( economical and political ) at that time . human entered capitalist society from feudal society . its early - phase preparation is firstly technological development and also cultural enlightenment
this is a comprehensive system , a culturally and economically inter - affected secure natural system .
if factitious then abandon
if universal truth then inherit , if factitious then abandon , this is not an issue of estimation !
the narrow / insufficient and short-sighted european cultural achievements
on the contrary if

international humanities history is not as believable as chinese humanities history .
do n't you know ?
what is value ?
your wisdom is buried here !
all day long this is flooded with stuff people do n't know themselves , but they still pretend to be experts and intellectuals . this is pathetic !
use ignorance to solve it
stinky fish and rotten shrimp are also seafood . just a kind
this is the most pathetic and miserable thing of some people at the present , they absolutely
but use
evaluating everything , and still tyrannizing the chinese mainstream media and discussions etc. , is already intolerable !
is all gone , the very basic
are all unfamiliar !
be aware of what you know and admit what you do n't know .
this is not some
problem
therefore only by treating illness as illness , one can be free of illness
what is value orientation ?
i 'm sure no one can clearly answer these two questions .
can that be knowledgeable ?
even do n't know how to handle such a simple case !
from now on , do less bad things and be less greedy and evil , it may improve !
stop eating because of a choke , use one to represent ten thousands , use partial to describe the full , parts to direct above
kid , you probably do n't even understand what value means !
everything uses ignorance to solve knowable , known , unknown , innocent and ridiculous arguments , such degeneration is the most pathetic !
sorry for the inconvenience

especially when gotten an extra advantage and still yelling about being advanced , can be called models ?
a huge step towards capitalism
certainly i am very supportive to learn this pattern , but can the national tax be exempt ?
that would be a good thing , that would be considered a pattern
you say it 's advanced when nobodys say anthing .
i cannot learn from you even you beat me to death .
hutie always spend money to build buildings but nobody buy them .
chongqing style is hot pot . do you fear hot ?

1000 cities can have 1000 patterns , and thousands of advanced experiences
baidu baike introduction
which becomes an important measure for chongqing to attract the tranfer of coastal industries
two measures work together . it 's called chongqing style .
may i ask where lang ya come from ?
fighting against gangsters and corruption and singing red songs , other places have done these things earlier than chongqing .
exempt federal tax , who 's production competitiveness wo n't be raised ?
why is chongqing famous , spend money hit on advertisements
chongqing is still far from chinese model student , more advanced provinces and cities in all aspect are numerous .
i was born in taoism base , master 's hometown .
so called this thing of singing red fight black , it is not new , but has always existed .
just in the past ten years , slowly abandoned , because of meaningless
iron hu old hua a tao 's base , taoist master 's home
do n't can it the left , you and i are the left wing
pattern must be original .
of why chongqin stood out , crying kids get more candies to eat , method of getting an equal share regardless of the work done , mao - leftist 's core of sun .
craftman , you need to consider the propaganda strategies for the princelings leader to ascend to power
xiang xi craftmen , even if you are short-sighted and conservative , you cannot flee from shanghai to jiangsu and zhejiang and still do not sell your labor when you are almost 70 .
you subei little beggar , could laugh at other people ?
carpenter in this field becomes a non expert .
after the retirement , sweat and toil money can be earned from bosses , so in conclusion , more sweat and toil be paid off than working under a big system .
on top these spin-offs are press - agentry for someone to get into chung - yang .
it 's very simple . if zhongyang is not good for him he can choose another province . if he does not like seashore he can go to middle - west .
hu tie lao hua 's speculation on north jiangsu little cheater makes a lot of sense .
i now live in heaven , free tour of classic gardens on sunday , hu chuan full course during the spring festival
how come short-sighted
xiangxi craftman , i heard of full scale , my hometown is very close to shanghai but i never heard of hu river full course .
you guys are all wrong , subei people often curse : la , little twerp
huchuan ( shanghai and sichuan ) imperial feast is a joke , because my family went from shanghai to do support work in southwest china for thirty years , then learned to make sichuan food .
small chilao is not always to curse , also is nickname , depending on the tone to differentiate .
hu chuan full course , the sour taste in sauerkraut fish is homemade , using taihu crab pickled with ningbo salt crab
sichuan food is too spicy . guys who are afraid of spending too much when treating others dinner go to sichuan food garden
chongqing phenomenon at least represents a kind of exception to the country 's future by quite a number of people
what said in the 41st post makes sense , when my mom chose which university to report , she chose the ones in beijing , shanghai and chongqing first for their possible future development
the dishes in local north jiangsu province
half of the dish is filled with spices .
let me talk about the security here , i keep a baseball bat in my trunk everyday , you think my life is easy ?
i view jiangsu , shanghai , sichuan , zhejiang food all as home food , and also there were lots of northern folks at third front factory , my wife also knows how to rise a dough to make dumplings , my colleagues from shanxi call us half a fellow countrymen .
which part in jiangsu does the workman from xiang xi live ? are you a half hometown person ?
you can draw a dao symbol on your car . you 'll be safe .
this is courtesy .
xiangxi worker you should first introduce yourself .
liu bang 's hometown dog meat well - known , but do n't know what the name is .
i also reported early , living in heaven .
ancient city peng city , peng ancestor 's home .
xiangxi workman cuisine comprise of four styles from xuhai , huaiyang , nanjing , and sunan .
have you ever tried peigong dog meat ?

capitalists are not evil , rather the capitalists who got rich through sycophancy and exploitation are .
now everyone in the nation is fighting landlord
those not - detestable capitalists also have the second concubine and the third concubine , wo n't they come up and criticize them ?
in reply to bench 's post , now how many capitalists are not clinging to the powerful and rich
you will understand the point by watching how the western powers are talking about the weaknesses of aircraft carries , but at the same time rapidly making more .
no matter who you are , your point is correct , which should be supported !
first settle the raw materials for building aircraft carriers and worry about the rest
china can only be described as lacking a long term strategic planning !

normal workers are cold . government employees are hot . – watch government employees taking exams .
deleting posts is hot , the forum is cold . guidance of public opinion may be right
i do n't understand , haha , dreadful power

firmly stop broadcasting imperial palace operas .
having broadcast so many imperial palace operas , if it were for the common people have gotten used to master , madam , young master , miss 's modern life , that is to tacitly agree common people are servants .
firmly request to stop broadcasting imperial palace operas .
firmly stop broadcasting shows about rich and powerful families
what is feudalism ?

15 million square kilometers , even over 2000 square kilometers .
over 9 hundred square kilometers
china has had its own map since the era of three sovereigns and five emperors
is earth a feudal product or not ?

is the milky way a feudal product or not ?

destroy our culture and ancestors , worship foreign stuff , do n't obey and respect parents . children , spend some time and work hard to read some chinese ancient books .
it 's okay to do so .
maybe the fans have been used to this kind of silence death , ironically , this failure was not even able to become a topic that people discuss
when we look at the chinese national soccer team without all the bias , we discover that since do n't know when , the whole society has lost the wholehearted passion for soccer .
only when all of us love it from the heart , all fans , all players , and rule makers love football , football then will become pure , not materialistic , spontaneous and not forced
hope there are more and more people will do the same as passionate company shen lu da wei yu , show your concern and let those people who really love dreams to have possibilities to seek and realize their dream .
do n't know if you do n't count , surprised when you count , since decided focus on soccer to reach so called world level ( dream is still dream ) for the past thirty some years , how much money was spent on soccer by varies locations and countries ?
40 billion yuan
the chinese male football spent so much taxpayers ' money , but what the taxpayers get is heartbreak .
one is buying lottery tickets , two is create a new wealth distribution regulation : fight landlord distribute land , three is robbery , abduction and assassination
where did people go today , nobody following posts , mr. third and mr. fourth , come on out
even getting into guangdong sub-region makes her so happy .
take out those and kill them who want to get rich overnight .
i did n't realize wuren has some insight .
the national development and reform commission released [ notice about diligently carrying out 2012 spring festival travel season transportation works ] today .
preliminary estimate , national passenger transport amount will be 3.158 billion person - time , increase 9.1 % from previous year . in that amount , 0.235 billion will be by train , increased by 6.1 % .
if 92 pairs of trains running , at least five hundred thousand people will be transported both ways daily , 40 days can transport 20 million people .
till the beginning of 2013 spring transporting .
at that time , spring festival travel rush may not be an inconvenience of any sort .
how can it be realized that people are the masters ?
how to prevent moral risks ?
half lie
however , where they go is different .
public mass can monitor any government official . that is the coming of true democracy .
is it possible in current system ?
foreman ?
they are not necessarily normal workers .
that was before 1980s
there has to be a mechanism
it is a rubber stamp anyway

since it is a public recruitment facing the society , it should not stick to one pattern but to widely recruit talents . from the perspective of the big picture of enterprise development , it should provide an opportunity of a fair competition to all ambitious and talented people
generally recruiters all long for more excellent talents to come and register , but only yichun broadcasting and television station is afraid of other people coming
it may well be asked , what is wrong with the leaders of this unit ?
how did people in relative government department faithfully perform their duty and how did they maintain the standard ?
careless ?
or there is something fishy behind this ?

it is made clear that it is internal admission , to put it bluntly , it is rigged . why do they have to make such embarrassing moves ?
in these days , if one wants to get some decent positions , one needs to either be good looking and dare to risk one 's life , or have first-class relationships .
i accidentally sprained my waist , they said it was a bone disease . just a sprain , it becomes a bone disease .

i hope this year the polity and police will unite and use strong-armed tactics against those black-hearted capitalists and their black umbrella protectors who are maliciously tardy in the payments of the wages of the peasants , so that by next year this terrible phenomenon is more or less eradicated !
coastal cities are the concentrating spots of peasant workers , and it is very important to echo the chongqing model to deal with this problem
thanks !
why did you seek help from those people who were claiming the poverty of rural workers was alleviated to offer help
in recent years , cases of malicious arrears of wages of rural workers have an increasing and more fierce trend , which have already risen as the top killer of the rural worker issues .
there are more people who have no other means except wait endlessly . to get their wages , some of them jump from top of a building , some of them get naked , some of them send greeting cards , some of them have to ask their wives to do it , all those means are applied in turn .

a sick man only recognizes money .
deserved punishment .
often is construction company owes implementation company 's money , implementation company owes contractor organizer 's money , then contractor organizer has to owe peasant worker 's money .
can you sincerely start with yourself to achieve the equality of all people ?
perhaps we cannot construct such limitation immediately , but our matting may very much need it !
because of various factors it is hard for hard to be really equal and democratic , then we should start by letting people know that sanitation workers are not humble
i myself am a common person
those elites indeed made contributions to the society , but we made contributions too .
do you dare to let go of your own speech with prejudice to see the world ?

china advocates the symbiosis of human and nature , the sciences are only objects to utilize , not purpose .
never harbor ill intention against others . at least we should learn a little bit poise
harming others is not an option , in that case it is hard to win others ' sincerity
it is easier said than done , but the best way is that we can learn not to easily criticize others

on one hand , it is trying to strengthen the buying power of us dollar in china and makes it appear that the us dollar becomes strong
china should sell an appropriate amount of us dollars
hold ?
it is all bought no matter how much all banks sell . rmb will be trash papers in rich people 's hands in future .
it 's even better if rich people take away all us dollars .
keep the product and its resource , it is the hard currency
small stock investors should not buy , nor should they sell
we should tighten the chinese currency , compress the inflation , this is the priority , we should prevent false economic heat and prevent speculation .

for seafood ( we ) can only go to your place , for rice noodle only at my place
in reply to post #13 . i have a big area of fish pond in my home , so this is not a problem . just try to make what little contribution i can
the seafood in the north has long growth period and tastes superb
you made a fair point . it really is that justice lies in people 's minds .
also , my cooking skill is ok , but not too much worse than those chefs in the restaurant , i guarantee you guys will have a good appetite .
what kind of fish are you raising
it feels less comfortable here with temperature of 10 degrees than your place with negative degrees
picture tells the truth , 5 cents is one of the many inmates in the jail .
are you liu da ?
i am planning to treat everyone for a big table of seafood , let everyone satisfies
feel free to eat , do n't call me miser then !
oh , right , getting to my place is very convenient , there 's high speed rail , however just wish it wo n't rain cats and dogs , there would be thunder and lightening !
i got several bottles of good wine for zuijianghu through some special relationship . it 's for high level government official only . i guaranty you that there is enough to satisfy your alcohol addiction .
in reply to post #31 . according to what you said , none of the leaders do good deeds ?
do you still call alcohol the booze ?
reply to the post on the 36th floor , i wish , but i do n't have the ability , maybe you could make it !
i have n't taken out the wine i saved in the bottom of the drawer , how could i get drunk in the jianghu

your ancestor gave me a dream long time ago .
it was the previous night before i went to your family ancestral . otherwise , why did i bath and change clothes ?
report completed !
in reply to post #13 , my ancestor appeared in my dream and he asked you to go down to accompany him , and it has to be now !
curse lovers , welcome and please come in !
all i said is truth
lu xun seemed to have mentioned it : when the boat leaks , bring the wine to float inside the currents . who cares whether or not the boat will sink
nothing like fixing problems exists in chinese medicine treatment
a ceiling , a nail
genuine person cannot treat big errors either .
sitting in the same boat , we have to consider it carefully
let 's said nu xun was right , right at the point !
reply message #23 , is leaking every where , how could you have mood to drink wine ?
drinking wine while bathing in hot springs , how pleased and comfortable the life is
excuse me , typo , reversed what i meant to say , sorry !

to reply the 44th post , that boat is too small , cannot hold so many people !
we 'll see .
us coal mining company paid over 200 millions as compensation for the death of 29 workers .
this is the most server mining accident ever happened in the u.s. in terms of casualties , has led to large scale concern about mine safety .
to say that yankees are not cheap
his 100 ton depleted uranium bombs in iraq is even more sensational . how are we supposed to interpret the united states
however , the sin committed by super nations were imposed on africa who did the least damage to earth , which is obviously against the law of nature !
this bill will also undoubtedly face the indifference and outcast of the united states , who is busy on the aircraft carriers !
still keeps the dignity of bandits . the pillage inertia of bandits
copy the form without understanding the substance . did they break the laws ?
at first you have to ask the laws of which country
the law of the country where the enterprise is located , one 's own enterprise can wantonly trample
now even if gaddafi were alive , heihei , his law
that is the criticism ?
i only believes in god 's ways .
there are unpractical laws as well , complete nonsense
must be bad !
every time someone is dead , the quickest and most prevalent headline of the report is that
how other people handle it is just a reference
the mine accidents in china , due to the inefficient supervision of the government , the principles of paperwork clearance between administrative agencies at all levels , basically are a capital game between economic principles , hidden rules , bosses and leaders
if human has to admire something , i think that one should admire one 's conscience . everything will be fine .
is n't it correct ?
rigid , rotting , stinky
i am chicken feeder , afraid of eagle !
clothing would never stink
the reason is very simple because ...
i am hungery now .
is yan song a student studying oversea ?
the reason is such : al qaeda once sent seven terrorists attacking china .
one tried to bomb a bus but failed to get on the bus .
one man was beaten up by the security when he tried to blow up the government building : dare you ask for the salary , dare you ask for the petition
a person was planning to bomb canton , once stepped out the train station , the bomb was robbed by motorcycle robbers , did n't click for several moments
al-qaeda decided to train a china - nized terrorist from young to attack china .
san lu killed him .
are you serious about it , i do n't believe so .
russia took 14 million square kilometers land from us , and those experts said nothing .

turkey has become a role model of islam arabic countries
turkey understands that islamic country will never integrate into western societies , and join the european union .
argentina started the action to blockade ma island .
if britain had no aircraft carrier it looks like argentina will challenge britain .
terrible , the world will be excited
i did n't know it until today
falkland islands incidence will continuously baffle britain and argentina .
it is to blockade falkland islands strait
the financial crisis in britain made it without aircraft carriers , it seems argentina is planning to reseize falkland islands
if china sold ground to ship cruise missiles to argentina , it would be enough to destroy the combined fleet formed by the great britain again
the europe has fallen . the countries in south america bullied by the great britain for centuries now start to hold their heads high .
falkland islands has a population of 3 thousand and over 10 thousand square kilometers , and is 500 kilometers away from argentina .
in 2020 , falkland islands return to argentina

on the other hand , chongqing style is to use ideological stuff to cover up realistic weakness .
the motivation behind is clear and no need to say it .
as for shenzhen , guangdong , it seemed there was some political reform wind two years ago .
now what common people want is neither the fucking ideology , nor the fucking pattern , but the word justice in large font .
hope the pattern quantified
what is the difference between the cake shared by chongqing and other places
rural workers all go to guangdong but not chongqing . what does that indicate
chongqing , that place sucks , just like the thread owner
chongqing pattern
simple enough , it is a watershed between serving the majority and serving the minority

sweet potato boy , your iq will increase 10000 points , guaranteed !
chinese people and their leaders kept their face but lost wealth .
anti-us is to give you something to do , dude
it can be seen that the primary element for chinese to be anti-us is that the united states is impeding the reunification of taiwan
guard the interest of the chinese nation !
as long as dividing other countries is good for the us , the us will ignore whatever democracy or sovereign or other such feelings
when the americans refunded the boxer indemnity scholarship program , it was a most difficult time when china was in the weakest state . but they did not take advantage of the circumstances to undermine china , instead they helped china and the chinese people sincerely .
correction : americans were the first to return the boxer indemnity , and americans returned the most of the indemnity , and till americans helped china to fight japan the most and sacrificed the most .
why china is anti - america ?
hope in this world there would be more people like bin laden , who thoroughly overthrow the american imperialism !
few years back online there 's a newly college grad , without a job , thought the country trained him , he must use his earned knowledge to repay the country .
what for ?
share the wealth of the united states , the capitalist country , and make the united states into a proletariat country .
it 's for american people to not live a slave 's life ...
it 's because america is too rich , we have been exploited by the americans !
chinese can really be proud now
but there are plenty among the chinese who think like that
not weird !
when japan invaded china , the us was providing resources to japan ( according some reports it is up to 80 % ) to attack china until they bombed the pearl harbor . they finally found out that they lift a stone and smashed his own foot .
, instead request old jiang quickly assemble expeditionary army ( four hundred thousand men in total ) to join battles in myanmar and india !
who 's heartless ?
12th poster wild real gold : you are full of lies !
you must first be a good person yourself , if you ca n't do it yourself than on what basis do you ask other people to do it as well ?
but we never say bad things about killers like saddam or gaddafi , are we still human beings ?
who deleted my post will get his family killed this year .
this must be definite !
why do we have to live under another 's roof
instead of being america 's servant !
damn !
and it must be a filthy place !
can people in the country become rich when americans are eliminated ?
i say the result would be opposite !
putting up insult from outside , at the same time bullying the inside , what kind of person is this ?
now fly out of bird forum , continue watching communists ever ugly reality performance , communists can continue using everything they got .
we do n't want there to be no america either !
so if china is a debt holder , why would listen to and be directed by a person with debt ?
in china , being an attendant to the servant is quite comfortable
in china , being an attendant to the servant is quite comfortable . never treat yourself as the lordmaster
to respect and look after one 's own country is right and proper thing to do
judging from the posts by the previous users , it is totally the case that a group of fathers of americans come to rule and lead the entire china
this topic is too heavy
anti america is not in line with the country 's interest , not in line with the civilization 's interests
have you ever visited any country before ?
all is hearsay , then what did you reply on to rub it in and refute completely
in an internet where what you say does not necessarily appear , why do we have the right to make irresponsible remarks
currently , the most realistic goal is to strike those who against ma .
because china 's servants hate america most .
it even requires the servants to disclose their personal assets !
if you have the guts , just keep deleting it !
small country self winning , china self winning
self winning becoming powerful : one can correct , two can perform charity .

big law is simple , has been the case , never solves the most fundamental problem , is ruling , regulating , developing , accumulating , circulating , traditions and other good !

real love / preservation/success just wait until their chinese cultural history standing is the same as the world 's history standing !

there is quite a lot of difference . strive !
to combine credibility and availability into one is useful
honesty and realism combined is practical guide .
pattern and law combined is law , this is the basis and presumption of human behavior .
incorrect fruition , no correction no limit
big countries are all self destructed .
therefore , if the individual survival and development of great countries are good
great country wins of oneself . great country wins of oneself
what rules do the chinese sages and their scientist and technologist followers had to meticulously follow throughout their lives ?

how did he do your grandma and your birth mother ?
he has his ability , but it is limited
i cannot post it , we can not even talk about putin here ?
he actually did nothing in economic development , and only revoked some of the resources monopolized by oligopoly but not all .
not tough at all
just an actor that russia needs
when he came to power , the first time petroleum price doubled , the second time it doubled again , the budget increased several times .
so i said he was lucky , he actually did not develop the economy
except oil prices .
did nothing , his mother 's god threw money on him .
military and technology had no big progress . the population is severely aging and deteriorating , with insufficient staying power .
unless putin can come up with another energy crisis , this would be his last term .
if there is no good things falling off the sky , it 's even hard to say if putin could finish his first term .
do n't even understand development 's hard facts .
set good and evil aside first , based upon the welfare of the russian civilians , putin is right .
just on the top of the wall , never to come down , occupying the opportunity of negotiation timing , interests for both sides will come in time .
if he was an honest man he would jump down from top of a wall . russian is not honest . that was a tradition .
face them !
stupid , they thought imitating uncle sam 's democracy could win freedom and fairness .
then it is meaningless .
should we learn from putin ?
zimbabwe is in a big mess , the government has gone bankruptcy , a paper bill is worth a billion local currencies .
does n't learn to let the son play ball .
russian people sincerely love pugin !
pugin is a thoughtful and bold person
do it yourself , pugin 's support rate is declining faster than my imagine
not much reminder , sentence before is honest , he did n't do anything that he should have done .
originally russia did not change anything ,
why to emphasize did nothing , just because there is an illiterate of your kind to blindly mix things up .
russia brings up pugin
about putin , i wanted to start a thread about it , since someone has already posted , let me take this opportunity to say something here , i think the putin phenomenon is a going back in history .
for putin 's personal capacity , do n't discuss now , at least i do n't think he is stronger than clinton , but putin 's dictatorship is obvious !
right or wrong , is going against the flowing of history !
russia is a european country , but it has no tradition for democracy . it was dictatorship during the tsar era , and dictatorship during the soviet union era . although yeltsin won back the democracy
however , someone in russia now want dictatorship back .
hehe , weird !
and putin allowed every russian not only be able to eat a full stomach , also doing things have become great ?

it 's been said long time ago . americans said that he is smart at least not a dumb . when he is dumb nobody is dumber .
with the mindset of preposterously hating america , what kind of psychological problem is that ?
if you think it is preposterous , it is indeed preposterous !
then just call it complicated ( mental symptoms ) .
there will be more . there will be no end if all of you do not laugh to death .

after the moral foundation is upside down in the whole society , people should not be surprised when weird things happen .
there are gentle rape , forceful rate , comfortable style rate ,
it 's not chinese that has its place . it 's the power that has its place .
most situations are like these .
as far as the destructive experiment is concerned it is a total quibble
if there is a problem , it is an accident .
the language used in the official statement is special .
do n't mention the explanation of specialty , there is indeed destructive experiment in the engineering industry

two headed gecko this weird thing appeared in the world again .
ever since the united states started , wars are uninterrupted , famine is everywhere , world economy is stagnating .

do you think that usa attack berlin was for peace ?
if during world war ii germany had defeated the soviet union , then today we might have a america and germany union , you never know !
atomic bomb technologies ?
history 's chance is not as simple as you originally think !
what did soviet union do when they entered berlin ?
let me ask you , do you know what war is ?
every step that america took , was for her own benefit .
he is giving out technology ?
what he sold was weapon . what he made was aircraft carrier . what he created is world-wide financial crisis .
xiangzhou district bureau of education at hubei xiangyang lately charged each current teacher a fee of 79 rmb , the reason was to soon hold a test for all teachers , 79 rmb is the testing fee .
why is there a fee ?
that is robbery !
that is called a nemesis .
if not using heart to grow heart , then every heart is empty , every thought is calm , from one buddhist country to another buddhist country .
one thought does n't grow , ten thousands law are dignified .
training 's basic is to correct thoughts , ordinarily must bring up the right thoughts .
every kind of fee the teacher collects from the students , is due to the pressure from higher ups .
the higher ups , the leaders , the teacher is powerless , is part of the oppressed , is also subject to slaughtering from those in power .
happiness lies in contentment , that is to say that as long as one knows to be content , and not greedy , one can enjoy happiness
one needs to understand how to be satisfied and be enough . give some interests to others , and leave some regrets to oneself .
people who really know the way of when to stop , also people who can really express behaviors , his life will be mostly wonderful , these kind of people not only will have bright young age , moreover having a happy old age .

stupid jerk !
however , if you act against me again in the future you will take the consequense .
poor huang shiren had to take it . who let him offend yang bailao before ?
it will not be anything just because who is who .
not having fair and just democratic policies as support , human being 's evil will reveal without hiding , nobody can avoid it !
you are saying cultural revolution is real democratic , right ?
during the cultural revolution , huang shiren was vice prime minister , yang bailao was vice chairman , they both could earn the same salary as workers and peasants .
li hongzhang 's self - strengthening movement , kang and liang 's hundred days ' reform are the country 's only way out
to establish a fair , equitable and reasonable legal system is not only necessary but also inevitable , this is the beginning of the return of the human beings rationality .
every dog has his day . the past yang bailao is no longer bullied and exploited by huang shiren
in the past huang shiren forced the marriage with xi'er . now make huang shiren 's daughter his concubine , is that unfair ?
recently , he is on the cctv 's moving china rank due to his devotion to his work in the past a few dozzines of years . hope all chinese men learn from xier 's husband .
shameless website trailer 's talking .
during cultural revolution , cadres open back doors , play line cutting with female young scholars , false accuse other people preventing from promotion
in response to post number 24 , what you said contradicts your opinion .
it 's more like it to fight and argue everyday .
therefore in order to not only safeguard the personal interests protection , but also emphasize the congruity and harmony between people , that 's where fairness and justice are needed .
therefore , in order to achieve real peace in human , the only way is to have a fair and just legal security as the foundation .
even an absolute equality cannot be guaranteed , unless everyone wants to be poor , because under an equal , absolute equal distribution , creativity of some elites will not exist
survive and living need justice

in this way , it can release internal requirements . in the same time , the related production chain can develop properly . currently , the related products take quite a big percentage rate in internal requirements .
avoiding financial risk is the main task for us at the hand , the liquidity of currency is still high
to broaden the domain that domestic companies invest , for example , schools and education , hospitals , sight - seeing , entertainment , to provide favorable conditions
adjustment needs to be appropriate !
china 's regulation is just repeatedly stabbing with knife to bleed you a little
if an investment satisfies the reasonable demands of the mass , then it is beneficial . from this perspective , market will react automatically , and what government needs to do is to clear away the impediment of this automatic reaction .
encouraging investment does not mean relaxing regulation , this is not the same thing .
corruption is still in the dark , the central government regulate the provincial government , and further down , let 's focus on the most important things first .
the areas lacking in development still need infrastructure investment , under reasonable plans , increasing investment is not a bad idea .
firstly , i 'd like to express my envy of russian people who have the right to express their own intentions
you are just a united states deputy secretary of state . russian election is russia 's internal affair
you are really a wild bird walking everywhere . you can be seen everywhere .
even those who have n't voted give all their votes to you , you still have less than 40 % of the votes . besides , you cannot win all the votes , do you think you can make vigorous efforts to turn the tide ?
finally , take a look at these several thousand anti - putinists . i think these several thousand are all pro - americans , which are party of the traitors , to put it in chinese , they are russian traitors
if you have such thoughts , you are not far away from betraying your country
at the end , looking at these few thousand people who are anti - putin , i think they 're all of the pro-american i.e. traitors party , in other words they 're russian traitors .
the u.s. has hindered the global development , the u.s. has hindered the global peace , the u.s. opposes the people on earth ( because they are having internal strife as well ) !
the theme of china economy in 2012 is to promote economic growth
growth rate of exports continues to decrease substantially , price index will drop substantially back to approximately 4.5 %
since european economy is going into a decline period in 2012 , the us economy would n't improve too much as well , china 's export surplus is perhaps almost nonexistent .
yasu projected , in 2012 chinese government will still use finance to execute major investment , promoting economic growth and insure jobs .
below is wild continent 's cpi for the next half year :
in 2008 , the government spent 4000 billion yuan in the budget to save the economy , but did n't expect that it pushed up the already declining housing prices by 60 % – 100 %
now more and more chinese females are catching up with westerners in their first and second years in university and then proceeding into marriage and childbearing does this show that chinese females are becoming more open ?

japanese families is generating electricity with solar power
it consists of a solar power generator , a transformer and a two-way meter , in the daytime it generates power and transport the electricity to the power grid and the meter is running in negative way , at night , it consumes power and retrieve electricity from the the power grid and the meter is running in positive way , there is no need to use storage devices
direction of electricity power : animal power generation

why there are only a few world-class scientists in china ?
similar provers in old chinese are you could find gold in the books , you could find beautiful women in the book and you could find tons of foods in the book
i wonder what are the opinions of other users ?
i did n't know it originally , i recently heard about a story of a peking university professor
chinese excellent scientists have fled to the united states
only confucius can be consulted about this question
surpassed current chinese scientists . replying number 8 's post

that is because those who make atomic bombs do not make as much as those who sell tea eggs .

how can scientists make as much money as chiefs ?
can newton appear in tang , song , yuan , ming , qing dynasties ?
confine a monkey in a box , then it is the same as a pig
who can tell me
the main thing is doing basic research ca n't earn you much money , and also ca n't obtain any research funds , therefore nobody wants to be scientists .
it 's not that schools ca n't develop experts , it 's because being an expert ca n't make you rich so nobody wants to be one , does studying about hu 's research principles make you rich ?
it is way better to have an official dad or rich dad than a scientist dad

china has many academicians .
he thinks that china has enough scientists . the topic owner is speaking nonsense .
you are not in the particular office , so you have nothing to do with plans for the administration of its duties . if there are questions to be criticized , that is their privilege
where do all these experts come from ?
no wonder there is no more scientists in china . allowing this kind of people to have the say , let alone scientists , there are even no good scientific assistants . they only know the profession of brown-nosing
if you wanted to say chinese scientists are numerous enough , you expressed well , but differs from reality ;
reply number 2 's post
confucius is not influence , is bad name attraction . reply number 9 's post
in reply to post #50
the theory of confucius is a theoretical view to support the government , detest the civillians and ignore humanity
it is the product of the era of the republic of china and revisionism governed education .
because brains were used in scientific development
in reply to #54 xiang xi
in reply to #53
what are the achievements made by your scientists in the republic of china era , during your republic of china era for your country in the republic of china era ?
why did n't these scientists make such achievements during the era of the republic of china from 1930 to 1950 . and still many scientists could only have the stage to perform after 1949 ?
the original question was to ask the two of you at which period . these two were primary or secondary school students during the year 1930-1950

rook , knight , cannon three checks , winning with beauty .
big poop mouth opening towards whomever , how can it not stink .
everyone who colludes with the communist party is stinky
first , if ma cannot be re-elected then they will blame song not only for blue party 's loss but also for imaginary negative effect to taiwan .
also as a candidate , in ma 's point of view , if soong wins the election , it will only have negative impact on taiwan .
just in case , why ca n't soong run for the president ?
the winning of other candidates will only have negative impact on taiwan
i said it long time ago . the election of taiwan is like a game and a total mess . it 's waste of time to pay attention to it .
i believe in taiwanese people , those who win the people win the world ...
persuading him to quit reveals a secret of ma
i think there is nothing inappropriate for soong to participate in election
how can one think of hindering others when one is afraid of being lost
what is the basis of positive argument and negative argument ?
speaking on the positive side , ma thinks that only if he is re-elected mainland china will be happy and taiwan will have advantages .
if james soong gets elected it wo n't necessarily be bad .
tan zhi is a true democrat
as long as the mainland has prepared for both it does not matter who will be elected .
therefore , ma advising song to withdraw is to clearly tell song do not mess up the situation and make his good things bad .
persuaded song to quit , explained clearly , if ma is not elected as the president , it 's because song joined the election
ma is narrow-minded can easily feel self - complacent , i 'm not optimistic at him at all
usa thinks hakani network based in pakistan made the attack and urge pakistan to take action immediately .
in my point of view , recently , the problem between the us and pakistan cannot be settled soon , the rift between the two countries will continue to increase
i think the united states released the grudge through this incidence , and will take the initiative to repair the relationship with pakistan in the period afterwards
i think the quarrel will still continue
i believe , this roadblock at the very least in the short-run will be impossible to remove .
maybe you have already been tired of such slogans like words , but deep in your heart , you still want to shout it out .
then how can china become the center of the world ?
from pictograms to the hundred schools of thought
all these have tremendous effects on china , created china 's education atmosphere .
high degree developed social science , can too become ingratiating manners in all situations .
you will always remember this .
can you hope that the teachers will be clean and not be affected by this muddy materialism society ?
can you hope those who are good at social science theory to invent space shuttle ?
to develop , you must start from education truthfully .
wait for the day when a foreigner is appointed professor by translating a publication of chinese . at that time , china will become the center of the world
does this world need a center ?
after holding the world hostage tell the americans i am the world 's center , i want to live by my values , do n't bother me , or else i 'll destroy the earth .
bitch gathering center , fake goods manufacturing center , tofu combining center , bullshitting center , all good centers , at messire 's choice !
dear son , are you a moron , still say it is quite centered
everyone , take your time to guess . do n't take this the wrong way !
the truth is , america is the country that has returned the most indemnity money and is also the earliest one to do so .
what reason do we have to fuss about them ?
you have to know that if at the time the us did n't aid generously , could china have won the war agains japan ?
at the time china and the us was close-knit like a family , the us did not leave china in its strife , instead aided the chinese people valiantly .
although in nowadays china and the u.s. have many conflicts and ideological differences , but the friendship between chinese and american people are really deep , we should not forget the history , should not even to blindly make enemies .
china has many domestic issues that urge to be solved , but these require sincere communications , but not hostility
many chinese people are anti-us blindly , of course there are also many americans that are anti - china , these actually are the most extreme and boring / unimpressive opinions .
the answer is absolutely a no !
being a normal person , i wish myself have normal method of understanding , not to follow those unrest making waves , because i feel that is meaningless .
people who likes to accuse others of worshiping foreign things do n't forget , marxism and lenin are both foreigners , many scientists that gave significant contribution to china are also from foreign countries .
therefore the term of fawning on foreign countries itself is the most stupid , boring and shameless term !
of course , there is an exception for sincere friends
this really is the truth !
anybody opposing is useless !
by the way to declare , myself is n't really anybody 's servants , because presently there is n't anybody worth my complete loyalty to !
but to serve loyally for the country is very important , of course , serving human kind is more appropriate , except this , no other wishes !
blind understanding is where the key of many problems lies , and it is also a drawback of many people . but we cannot follow blindly , because it is related to the survival of the entire human race , including us .
thanks a lot !
all these long years why has taiwan been sucking up to america ?
then where does our mainland china 's growing economy get it 's advantages from ?
from our grandchildren 's resources .
he is just like his father , if his own father is corrupted and making mistakes , can his children curse him ?
obviously cannot !
but we absolutely cannot blindly make enemies
have n't you heard and seen how china and the us are behaving over the south china sea issue
go ask your parents what blandly worship foreign stuff means !
as long as they do n't put me to death , i should be thankful to all those enemies .
when i 'm up you 'll forced to call me number one .

bandit mr. gong is kind of bandit that sells resources then buy ancestors .
why we are not looking for causes from our own bodies ?
therefore , i think americans are already very tolerant to china !
in reply to post #30 , these are all caused by historical reasons of the chinese people
but building up a correct understanding of humanity indeed needs to be done with no delay
without the massive assistance from the united states and others to past china , china is done already !
make a fool of yourself !
it 's a pity that you ca n't go back , the environment has been totally destructed , all those animals in the mountains are gone , one would die of hunger !

our traditional agriculture is still the best
modern agriculture is not good , all relying on machines to till , those are foreigners ' stuff , ca n't use

oh , yes . steel is the invention of the foreigners , our ancestors do n't use it at all .
if you have interest in ancient way of living , you definitely could do it yourself , no need to say these many wasteful words .
that was then . this is now .
reply to 49th thread , however , the people in cities have done what peasants longing for . if peasants do n't bring food supply for exchange , what else can they do ?
reply to the post on the 50th floor , do n't you know that people in yuan dynasty were pretty open-minded and democratic . otherwise they cannot even survive , not mention they defeated other countries .
people from the huaxi village could enjoy things that people in the city cannot enjoy .
true gold student , do n't get mad so easily . is n't everyone discussing problems peacefully ?
at that time there were not even blue bricks and boulder strips .
can ancestors be dis - owned this casually ?
do n't light a fire either , better just eat raw meat directly
what huaxi village is doing is what cities are doing . it is industry . do you understand ?
stupid ass
if there is money , factories can be built
good point !
under the circumstances that invaders had entered the capital of our country , they were obtained by force and blackmail , therefore it was illegal .

the ministry of foreign affairs must make a severe announcement to express severe concern on the affairs of afganistan and pakistan borders
cold war mindset
the ministry of foreign affairs announced
chinese army and air force entering pakistan will greatly encourage the morale of pakistan people and army .
it is also a great spiritual and military backing for the pakistani to close nato bases and stop support operations in their country !
they should be determined to stop a war with a war . that way , the war threatening that pakistan faces can be eliminated .
china can also break the encirclement that usa is creating .
go away , damn idiot
i did n't see any reaction from wry footstep
regarding this case , if we still persistently hide our ability and pretend to be weak
it 's time now to stand strong !
fighting back when you are forced to a door or when you are cornered , which one do you prefer ?
if china and russia collaborate on military , then each of the two so-called big countries have its own living space
zhu zhong wei , where reported ?
it finally exposed america 's determination to propel its military force eastward .
attacked civilians by error , accident happened every three to five days from allied force . no matter how they explain those are accidents , they could not get back their losses and affects . this is the price to pay for fighting against terrorists .
cooperation , is not necessarily beneficial to pakistan itself
ability is limited
you still want to guard , what will you guard . will pakistan invite chinese troops to guard ?
otherwise , if the crisis with pakistan

right ?

regretfully , china is not afraid of america imperialism in mao 's era . it 's totally different now .
as for bin laden 's death , this is not only a loss to afghanistan 's anti-american work , but is also the loss of anti-american campaign in the americas , europe , or even the world .

hush hush speaking freedom of speech received beat down .
ha , this is quite an interesting historical phenomenon
this absolutely has nothing to do with those in the nanfang newspaper group who are claiming they are vulnerable . how can the nanfang newspaper group holding tens of chain stores be more vulnerable than the people who are cursing it ?
actually everyone on the earth knows that scolding nanfang group has nothing to do with free speech but something to do with defending personal value .
ha , there is no simple answer to this damn question .
this big proposition .
this is likely a gradual recognition process
goes against their individual interests
damn !
monk kong !
brother tan , running in the opposite directions exists all the time and it is the nature .
clear headed people such as chen yun and others were sealed by no argument . the mouths of jiang qing , chunqiao , and others were sewed together by definitely no argument .
haha , southern post got new skills which is : we will play freedom of speech .
also asking to use repairing to protect the line !
i totally agree with the incisive analysis by kan xiong in post #6
but seen from the situations so far , such probability is smaller than point one percent
life will be more comfortable
less whining , more practical deeds , at least you can learn from taiyuan to buy several pages of nanfang zhoumo to burn . if you have guts , just give impact to nanfang newspaper group , people will support you .
a group of bad asses , who can only talk in front of traitors , come one , show some guts . man , rise up . haha , look down on your group of leftist maoism wimps
is it done by just making fun of the traitor ?
the side cursing it , including most of the people in the west and north guangdong regions , all think that if china wants to be truly prosperous and powerful , it must follow the path directed by mao zedong that is self - reliant , hard working , independent and self-reliant
also , it was in the southern guangdong region . accompanying the society privatization money is concentrated in the hands of minority people .
they always see you as a chicken . can you be strong ?
stupid rightists , viewer grandpa never said whether the yobs in the nanfang newspaper group were traitors or not . my magnificant article has n't been finished
* profanity *
has sperm ?
i see is still flinching , basic job has n't been done right .
kan boss has mentioned necessary to change direction drastically ?
anyway the boat does not belong to revolutionary masses , but to revisionists . who fear that it may capsize are not us .
urge them to steer quickly
conscious people are increasing by the day .
comparing the opinions of both parties , any objective person can reach a definite answer that nanfang group yobs are obviously short sighted and anti - intellident
then are those stupid yobs of nanfang group really traitors ?
naturally , can they be considered definite traitors ?
because , the judgment for traitors , actually also has many very precise definition .
these , obviously southern weekly 's thugs have n't done before , at least have n't done it publicly !
ha , viewer grandpa , however , is inclined to think that yobs of the nanfang newspaper group is the main mouthpiece of the traitor - producing nursery after 1840 and a harm of the country and people
issue 's seriousness is at , traitor 's betrayal has touched nation 's and race 's survival bottom line , to protect national interest and race 's survival
colorful mouse is cussing on the street again
they push the capitalist anti-revolutionary line and feverishly suppress the workers ; if they control a part of power , they will immediately go and revise the story of the great cultural revolution
the targets of revolution are capitalists . the focuses are those who are party leaders and walk on the road of capitalism .
the unrepentant capitalist - roaders represent the interests of international imperialists , revisionists and reactionists , and the interestes of capitalists inside and outside the party
of course , if other revolutionary mass persist that the southern media system are real chinese traitors the readers have nothing to say
look dumb , haha , size 120 emergency foot brake plus hand brake ya , a little irreverent , using revolution crowd as scapegoats , just like chairman mao , congratulations

in the referendum of our website , stupid children are already lost , ha , viewer grandpa , why do you need to be so irrational
applause !
ha , blatant , damn
lost ?
for a media , when it is attacked by people like monk kong , and its self defense cannot be accepted by the public , this means that : it is dead .
what more do you want to watch attacking
this is called media battle
it is a very normal thing
ma ying-jeou 's economic strategy is based on data , but he does n't let people feel the improvement of the economy
if you say the annual growth is 5 % , if people cannot feel it , even 20 % is useless
the difference is ma yingjiu says it should unify in the end ,
if it 's this difference , then i would still vote for cai .
are n't they those kinds of people who change their minds frequently
do n't know whether the reason is his personality or the localization of the kuomintang
just like green party , kuomintang will soon have a hard time holding the food bowl .
are n't shamed to say republic of china ?
at wild training , pretend like real training , looks like a unskilled arguing female .
very simple question , very easy battle choice .
he deserves failure .
he threw away the biggest advantage , his loss is expected
could you please find a few officiallings in the mainland china
it is normal no matter who lose
at that time , the poll showed he was behind a lot . he faced the opponant who was handsome and had higher support rate .
it was not normal because cai yingwen cannot compare with ma 's privilege .
he is really getting into the trip set by the green party .
once the night market is doing well , jobs are easier to find , more people travel there , the economy will increase 10 % ...
cai said the growth now benefited from the 8 years of chen shuibian 's work , this style of reasoning is the same as the argument at phoenix forum
three fools , one lost to the other , is normal phenomenon !
i like those who have political wisdom more .
people has strengthen their memory for negative information , but weaken their memory for positive information ...
they generally think that they deserve to be treated well .
of course there are differences , let mao xiaopang try it out .
is it because economy failed ?
imported too many weapons ?
does ming jin party get stronger than when they were in power ?
can you say this is normal ?
why is it non - normal ?
where does the abnormals come from
who manipulates ?
does n't ma ying-jeou do good enough what he is told be the united states
only one thing : the united states wants to tell the world he can manipulate those
what about china ?
should n't they be tossed into the pacific to feed the sea turtles ?
this has a background in a big picture
the ten percent growth is likely on the paper .
she is only contriving
but rather that ma was very inept .
because he did n't contact with his peripheries ?
this is an agent voted by the citizens community .
it is not him giving chances to the public , he did n't have any credit .
he was just a leader in a public service agency for a few years , nothing else .
number 1 , the economic environment in the whole world is too bad . the support rate to all government officials is decreasing . it 's not just for ma .
third , ma gave up the most important factor , the issue of china 's two sides .
say where is the problem of cai yingwen ?
2 , cai yingwen 's economic policy is in line with the interests of middle and lower classes .
creating career , increase basic income
could say that cai ying wen 's complete everything 's basis .
she wants to merge towards the middle , at least pretending .
then he is exhausting the natural advantages and allies .
the original poster , why do n't you try it yourself , do n't fabricate here ah .
i ca n't compare with ma cai , a little better than little fatty no problem .
no , do n't talk say me , even my son can
why would i try just because you said to try ?
you spoke too much nonsense .
taiwan 's politic is out of order if he is asked to step down .
negative effects will be large in the future .
the present is merely the future 's past .
other than soldier 's sortie , which is an extremely rare case .
the ones produced after , they all have low ratings .
greed is human being 's instinct .
no money to cure disease , no house to live , we will be despised by those who will laugh at poor people but not prostitutes .
chinese morality applys to gentlemen not mean people .
it will not feel good to be poor .
this is feudal bureaucratic thinking
just because developed countries have discarded this type of thinking
human nature is neither good or evil , it is environment that forms the understanding and appreciation of the definitions of good versus evil .
the desire has no limit , so does the greed , how human being are changing that fast ! ?
1964 , yang li shen starred in a story ( a shi ma ) of wide screen colored film produced by shanghai production company
originally talkative and lively her became taciturn and introvert . she had been diagnosed as schizophrenia . she often had severe symptom of imaginary sounds .
in the cultural revolution , how many kind people like beautify a shi ma were made insane and disabled ?
that was an era when people were changed ghosts , an era people ate people .
i would n't believe it even if you beat me to death that a shi ma is modern anti - revolutionary .
i do n't know the facts about yang likun . but it should have a real factual statement .
reply to bandeng 's post . that was the time when you live or die was controlled by other person 's mouth .
in the big stream of class struggle , society was torn and divided into different classes . humanity was destroyed . people were against each other . should we think again ?
ha ha , i was born in 60s too .
that was an era when the ugliest side of human nature was exposed . it 's an era when a person could be an evil or could be a victimized ghost .
everybody has responsibility to promote a harmonious society .
what a celebrated saying !
remember .
you cannot judge beauty from one 's face , while one 's behaviors and political alignment need to be proved by facts
if you become the judge , once you see someone who grows pretty you must release immediately from the court !
a person is pretty or not can be seen from face . however , a person 's deed and life path need to be shown by facts .
according to your way to judge a person based his / her looking those beautiful people should not take drugs or cheat on taxes .
according to your judgement method based on a person 's looking , those stars should neither use drugs nor cheat on their taxes .
they should have not participated the partisan struggle .
a border , that was not a good idea .
currently , ignoring social morality makes people selfish ...
original poster , you need to go to the hospital to attend to your disease .
the moderator prevents me from voicing my opinions , so i will just stop arguing with you .
if time went backward , peking university professor kong squinted at you and said you did n't look like a good guy , then you might go to prison
are the questions considered by my ass clearer than those by your head ?
once , say that you do n't look like a good person , how other people do are not based on your imagine to make conclusions .
just exactly explain that yourself is this kind of person !
who do not think with your head and proud of being hypocrites .

i am legal chinese citizen called wang huai chun .
i read the constitution which states that if you are a legal citizen , then you have a right to elect and be elected .
what is its method ?
and why it is not qualified ?
no one has this right
there is a problem in the original post
the few administrator that are high on top of the to be administrated will be eliminated by time . this is a time when 80 % of the citizens are equal and owning their own fate , hehe !
i can see through normal people 's spirit . but normal people cannot feel the capability of my dialysis .
people will never understand why i 'm not talented chaplin or edison .
a weak country , a small country , a powerless country ,
or this country itself and the people who lost morality do not know how to explain morality ?
if not that way will there be a day that everybody cheats ?
if necessary please send death model to those who do not think about people 's benefits !
the rmb is appreciating as a cover of the bear market
like a pair of beggar 's shoes , insisting that it 's worth [ ten us dollars ] .
everybody feels it , who is happy , the american imperialism is happy !
they first speculate in stocks , then in swine , garlic , medical herbs , now in everything to see how the government deals with them . all those are normal people 's necessities .
normal people see this most clearly . the top level people know this in their heart . those experts are silliest . they just talk about it and draw on a piece of paper .
it lets poor people get poorer .
it is worth thinking carefully .
no way to make money
wealth accumulation causes poverty expansion . lao ma said that over 100 years ago .
poor people yell hungry everyday , rich people practice fashion everyday , this is modern chinese reality .
marx 's country is also capitalism , but how did they make it relatively fair ?
those who get rich first will help others to get rich , opening up a red-light district is one of the shortcuts
others are busy with trading money for power
most are committing crimes !
had a dream , said taking the route towards common prosperity
the people who got rich first all immigrated abroad !
why did they have the guts to cheat the national scientific progress prize ?
wealth comes from labor .
tremendously increasing their oppression of the poor and destitute without reservation !
in china on earth how many unsatisfied women are there , in millions ?
nonsense . except monopoly enterprise , bigger enterprises all started with small size
short selling ?
stocks , stocks sooner or later will make a plump wallet all gone !
they are just afraid of telling the truth , so they beat around the bush .
really took a good heart , and treated it as dog organ .
go around
russia promised iran for its security to get the united states ' advanced unmanned airplane for study
china wants it too but does not have encouragement to do anything .
you could not sell law with money , morality weighs a thousand kilograms !
if there is no just and fair social system , morality does n't worth a penny .
now spring festival show not only is shameless , moreover has became a few people 's profiting tool .
the detestable ma dong is a ridiculous idiot . if he did n't have a dad like ma ji , how could he idle at cctv for so long
now there are finally experts within the popular culture circle that evaluated ( zhao ben shan ) 's eunuch culture and hooligan sketch and gave stern criticism , this is a celebratory kind of cultural advance .
this is not only their self retardation , lack of manners , also it is their personal character 's evil and vulgar .
need to let manchuria opera go all over the country , go towards the world .
in southern cultural traditions , who would publicly laugh at old , weak , ill , and disabled , these pitiful population ?
southern china does n't have the self-knowledge like the northeastern comedians do , it is natural for a conceiving and fraudulent cultural market to exist .
the so-called art performers who make fun of the old , the weak , the sick or the disabled , are themselves idiots with handicapped personality and low morality .
stop for 2 years first .
is it eastern sleeping lion or waking lion ?
this is a challenge to the bottom line of the chinese cultural morality , moreover , it does not benefit the ethnic unity and social harmony
waste money and manpower . be a fool for one 's pains
dongbei short opera made by guys like zhao benshan , gong hanlin , pan changjiang is vulgar stuff , imitating and making fun of our compatriots , the old , weak , ill or disabled all day long as punch lines
in the new year 's gala programs , those chinese people whose ancestors wandered overseas several generations ago , still do not forget what is flowing in their bodies is the blood of the chinese nation . they sincerely use their hearts to appreciate the motherland , appreciate our nation .
are they still qualified to sing about the peoples , the country ?
do our spring festival celebration still let these ungrateful , sacrilege brats run rampant ?
support chen peisi 's rejection again to perform on the new year 's gala
brave media people , do you dare to report this incident ?
every year our new year 's celebration 's skits are actually promoting this kind of thing ?
in the current china , all trades and professions will end up in this embarrassing situation as soon as the northeastern people are gathered
basically agree with the point of the thread owner
spring festival is like carrots and cabbage , of course everyone likes something .
comparing here and comparing there , still like zhao 's product .
i wish the new year 's gala is organized better and better
this is the historical result . those vulgar fake culture fooled many audience many years are eliminated mercilessly .
politely asking , which country is unable to send their own kids in cars , but donate cars to foreigners ?
presently is not the time to close doors and wash up .
may i ask which country has that kind of strong country mentality as you said ?
western countries did not have this since 150 years ago .
the public can not possibly vote for a person or a political group who do n't take public finance seriously
that side has even contributed high-end school cars .
traitors and bad officials use the sweat and toil of our people to buy faces , things that live on our people while helping others secretly
it seems that guy is also a thing who drinks american soups
does n't have anything to do with americans , americans would never do it this way .
opposition party wants to discipline him , two houses want to jointly investigate him , in the end his party comrades would ask him to leave too .
it is a civil society . there is no such specialty
do n't even understand an unpleasant appearance , a result from long term lack of democratic ideology .
if folks on the internet do n't come out to speak , will people 's voices be heard at all ?
national traitors
the development of an inevitable trend
hello , british workers , my friends
rogue capitalists make the world a whole mess
millions self-conscious workers
will transferring the guilt to those hooligan in financial crisis trigger war ?
i estimate it would be fast .
against war and support peace
our purpose is spread to the world
vietnam and philippines invade and occupy our territorial waters , which we will firmly protect !
it should n't be forgotten that russia seized 14 million square kilometer of our territories
moreover , must not forget those comrades who bled and sacrificed for protecting the borders !
do n't forget those comrades who fought and sacrificed in the ussuri river zhenbao island and tielieketi invasion by the soviet union in 1969 !
why not retract from market with this kind of garbage
main board is waiting to jump in water

let pakistan become failure of terrorism 's scapegoat .
only get out is the best solution !
they want to withdraw . they do n't care if afghanistan is alive or dead .
if they really withdraw can those who follow nato very closely go with them ?
if that is true why did they start this war ?

these two things should all be obeyed strictly !
possible or not , self aware self constrict from reproduction ...
rich and high class are self understanding !
fixed well .
human kind 's first thing , clear and clean its
can love marriage / form a family raise children and so on
only those people who have achieved virtue and self-knowledge can be in charge of this important mission / task/responsibility/obligation etc. !
natural rules include people 's various ways to live .
in all evils , lust is the worst .
kings and queens / nobles and ministers , etc
westerners have not yet been enlightened with regards to this , and in fact are helping it grow
and has been flooded as a disaster , now it 's spreading to the rest of the world . this is humanity 's greatest issue , if not solved then man-made problems will only get worse !
punish the king queen / princes ministers
1 . have several families
the family still has four / five children .
this kind of family is no exception
2 . in a few families
3 . in a few families
nowadays marriage is probably a game of affection , there is no culture involved
have families , sons and daughters
ancient people knew to take the blame on themselves , being an emperor , officials , emperor
what do civillians have to live on ?

protect love and marriage that fits the law of nature . do n't protect but harshly punish love and marriage that does not fit the law of nature
if an emperor often blame oneself , he will harm the common people one hundred times less
contributor
large oversea , large foreign , large nothing , large business , big mess , big war , etc.
it must cause more and more big false spreading .
to eat and to have sex are human natures
it 's priceless to know yourself
many doctors are oblivious too
the healing profession itself has lost morality in exchange for profits , becoming a killing profession
love cannot be forged , marriage should not be urged either . regardless of men or women , one should treat love and marriage seriously . love and marriage are neither casual behavior .
especially officials supporting mistresses becomes one of china 's main production , later on , short people , incest reproduction appearance 's probability will dramatically increase !
later on , incest , close relatives reproduction appearance 's probability will dramatically increase !

beautiful message !
at ( people and elites ! )
praise ( shan men jing ) 's view point
oh , i never read book and newspapers , and i ca n't appreciate poems and paintings , if you ask me what do i know ?
if you spend enough time with dog , you could understand dogs languages , not mention some foreign languages
in a hundred years it is always chaotic , countless things will all cease
traditions have bound sage zhou , customs has controlled confucius .
wild people like holidays , sitting there still far away .
looking at thousands of hair , how can it compare with tens of thousands of dandelions
there are two people under moon . this is description .
there are two people hand in hand under moon . they walk back and forth near the pond . poo tong , they fall into water . this is a story .
this is poetry .
expressing emotions , would be poetry .
lu xun quipped that when it is translated , it is actually , beautiful fair lady , makes a good couple with the young master
it is just like this , nothing else
confucius gave the standards : mind must be pure .
according to your criteria , the poem i wrote to the beautiful girl you you , is not a poem ?
not necessarily .
one malus is full of quinces , these seven words can be as dirty as you want it , but it 's a poem , and is very famous .
tang poetry , of course is good
reading a good poem , you can feel the author 's happiness , anger , grief and joy and change of emotions
bullet brother , greetings
they exhausted all the tricks , so they had to be deliberately mystifying
and they still feel good about themselves
how great is it to have someone intimate
someone likes to be social
someone likes to bluff
someone likes to follow the herd and kiss ass
oh likes to walk back and forth
lao tan likes to kick ass .
actually , it is more accurate to say he used poems to express his feeling .
that is true when you read and think it carefully .
no one has read the post for a long time
you are way out of line to always think of other 's ass
it actually is my intimacy
they should dispense with formalities
what kinds of hobbies are these
i kept summoning yi sha and locust tree in the post
there are so few people tonight . no fun at all !
go to guilin to find broken pot
spittoon 's writing , i admire very much
guilin local forum , the name is still broken pot
guangxi forum ?
he should go to a larger forum . local forum is too small for him .
a group of young girls surround him and listen to him . pohu is well welcomed just like the king of monkeys on huaguo mountain .
the reason is that they do not know what is poetry and opinions vary
the so-called poetry by the three voyeurs , are definitely not poetry
( looking happily at the thousands of wheat waves , heros everywhere are setting with the sun )
poems can pack the emotions and fly endlessly through thousands of years ( the bright moonlight shines beside my bed )
never read books or newspapers , neither understand poems , calligraphy and paintings . do you understand eating ?
actually , poem is the intellectual 's brightness shining through , things that are small are very afraid of it
poem can moan while having no disease
poem can express dirty thoughts
most of times , is self torturing self , if you do n't understand then learn it honestly , what more could be said ?
you do n't understand man-made satellite , man-made satellite is ignorant ?
regarding the evil humanity , ignorant nature and irrational arguments , i 'm afraid in this forum it is impossible to find a second one
especially in china
deep cultivation originates from the mind . that 's classic !
more comical is that universities seem like cow furs everywhere , but gifted man are like phoenix furs and dragon horns , hard to come by
countryman 's laughing material , still is from farmer 's mouth !
this paragraph by lexie ( joyful evil ) , gives a vivid commentary for the poem , only that diving in the water in the cold weather , you would freeze to death if not drowned , then ascend .
common people write buddhist songs , poems , talking about love , and the falling of lotuses ?
now i remember . in the old days in china , an old rich man who 's a landowner , his son had a poem , which talks about not having to worry about clothing or food , and having a good life , what thinking is there to do ?
this is for sure , all day long donkey bray is a poem , lotus fallen is a poem , thus the classic of poetry can only unconvincingly be counted as poetry .
it has nothing to do with being a peasant or not
gets wealthy and become a landlord or capitalist , and can still cause people to laugh
are you an elite ?
you can say that it 's a perspective to a subject .
send your detail personal information by text message to 2011-12-512:4953 . it 's a piece of work that countrymen can laugh at . it 's from a farmer .
his country life accumulated abundant creative inspirations and materials for him
arts originate from life , do you think it is wrong ?
many works of zhao benshan , are written by he qingkui
look at the forum , who is abusing words ?
i dislike current greenhouse education method .
when can you see a case when morality is used to defeat natural law
life is wasted in the research on this fake , boast and empty political lies until death
it is just the man-made disasters by the bad deeds of the official private schools and ignorant officals
spend the whole life in confusion and suddenly realize the truth not until death
without the japan invasion , there would n't be a people 's republic of china
why doe it sound like cambodia and north korea ?
welcome – here corrupted government officials are too abundant – come here and you are guaranteed to become rich – and maybe can even become a savior it 's hard to know
someone posted a long paragraph in the forum , actually , he has only a couple of points , he can make it clear with a few sentences
sometime i simply ignore it
i sit on a rock alone on the river side . i am watching the scenery and reading under the sun .
a group of geese are playing water in the river . what a pity there is no fish in blue waves .
five bridges connect two river banks , seas turned into fields , what a great change
today i have nothing to do but doodle around , an old man myself suddenly have the same passion and ambition as youth
what five six said is correct !
it 's apparent , ordinary life is free from restraint , make people envy .
a very good gardening poem .
56 , great snapping !
it can be seen that the thread owner has a good command of poems
this poem is exactly like that
five six , in my post , every time that person talked about your relationship with yisha
i suspect your relationship are platonic ?
a few days ago yi sha just taught you writing poems need to have rhythms , even you could n't listen into it , at least poems should have artistic perception ?
have n't seen a thread for a long time . greetings
artillery , greetings
sitting alone on the rock by the river bank , the grass is turning yellow everywhere
a group of geese are playing water in the river . and falcons fly far away from me .
five bridges connect two river banks . the mountains and waters in my hometown are as beautiful as a picture .
hopefully son and grandson can still enjoy .
looks like 56 likes to play go !
she should n't show off
only babbling , expressing feelings only !
you still have n't told me where your homeland is .
, but it does n't seem like it
mouse is mellow and graceful , not like open teeth and dancing claws .
group feeding goose locations are not common in the south .
but i guess that should be an old flame of yours
we are all passers-by on the internet . it is just a verbal conflict , let it go
likely in these three provinces
why is n't there a beauty who throws herself on me ?
mental masturbation is also bad for your health

the maoism fanatics are eighteen thousand kilometers away from the maoism fanatics in xinlang forum . if you do n't agree , go and have a look , both are maoism fanatics why there is such a huge difference

thousands of years , the sea changes several times
in reply to post #49
very much . i feel that the thread owner is not a professional writer . however , an amateur can write with such level , which is very valuable
although we are not professional writers , at least we often do rhetorical exercise . we are different
this poem , if you read it carefully , it is really a good one
right , at least it feels really pure and innocent
even if you read a lot , if you seldom write , you will feel inarticulate
weakness is lack of self , but most people are not able to reach that point .
complaints are n't all given , but organs already are short
children time water was clear , and fish play in it
curvy river water has already been cut off
i long for this kind of countryside life .
however , when environment and external factors call the original kindness and ugly hidden at the bottom of hearts are twisted . kindness changes to evil and evil will change to craziness .

i 'm not interested in those who came back from france .
some employees of the department of justice and some part time employees of notary public agencies
are paid by notary public angencies .
just take certifier 's signature stamp that represents certifier 's identity and give to ordinary worker
if ordinary worker at the certifier 's office
from the point of view of the law
this illegal certification process , the entire process for processing certificates , is overseen by staff at the notary office
this is a severe illegal behavior !
the behavior to issue certificates with the greffier signature stamp of the parttime greffier in the bureau of justice
from legal perspective
however , the administrative staff at the notary public offices are the impostors as greffiers to conduct illegal behaviors to issue certificates illegally
is in fact the behavior to rent or lease the identity of a greffier
administrative staff use greffier signature stamps that were borrowed or rented to issue notary certificates
such behavior is severely illegal behavior
this is what i think , every user , what is your opinion ?
users , please have a discussion
does the behavior of lending or leasing greffier signature stamps by greffiers violate the criminal law
does the behavior of borrowing or renting greffier signature stamps violate the criminal law
have some doubts , consulting each netizen .
should or not set up the law :
set up ( certifier renting , renting certifier 's signature stamp ) offense .
notary public office is public institution
the salary they get from the bureau of justice is a public account
in this way , they get two salaries in the two units of the bureau of justice and the notary public office .
that goes without asking
thanks for the support , lotus pond night color
just like the crime of illegal medical practice
the greffier lending leasing greffier signature stamp crime ?
does not have to legislate
lending official seal , unless not used , once it is used it can be committed as the crime of forgery
the lender may also be charged with malpractice .
thanks for the users ' suggestions
notarial certificates issued by phony greffiers
user yi sha 's suggestion
investigate on earth the civil servants of which bureaus of justice
which people have lent or leased greffier signature stamps to the administrative staff in the notary public offices
among them which people have got benefits by renting or leasing greffier signature stamps
if you have dealt with notary process you can look at a notarized document .
however , when you need a document be notarized you may not see a notary public .
the whole process of civil law notary is operated by the assisting personnels
this conduct of unlawfully issuing notary document is truth violating ,
how could it be ok with just a signature stamp on the notary document , would n't it also need a official seal ?
based on understanding , should represent notarize officer personally signed
the behavior of borrowing , renting notarize officer 's signature stamp to produce notarized document
notarize officer is busy temporarily cannot go to work , can assign other people to represent him
representing the civil law notary himself signing on the notarial certificate
then a judge can also lend his id to others to issue a judge ?
on top of it , judiciary office 's public officials also hold positions as notary personnel .
that is too acceptable ?
sign in front of a notary personnel ?
it is a simplified procedure for notary to sign names on the affidavit .
simply like , the judge cannot entrust others to judge cases .
the civil servants in the bureau of justice cannot be a notary as a part-time job
collude with administrative staff at the notary public office
is totally making trouble
greffier signature stamp represents the signature signed on the notary certificates personally by the greffier
this kind of identity cannot be delegated
if the president takes a shot , delegating the vice president to perform his duties
three-year old emperor authorized regency , used emperor 's seal .
can notary public authorize other people to notarize documents ?
can they run wild like that ?
now some notary official are making a fool out of themselves
how can we use the feudal emperor 's corruption
the socialist legal system is not the feudal emperor 's seal
how can you use the feudal emperor 's seal
these behaviors are severely illegal forgeries , which should be harshly punished
chen xiaoshan , a professor of hunan agricultural university who is also a stock holder of green leaves company , said that the numbers that green leaves company of changsha reported are fake numbers . there are some hidden problems for the scientifical and technological improvement award it obtained .
judge , prosecutors definitely do n't learn from them ?
prosecutor also go to work at political organizations , give permission to others to prosecute , investigate cases
just like those dis - regulated certifiers .
many notary publics who have second jobs are doing it insanely .
speaking here can be more accurate in using words .
therefore , it 's more accurate to say this :
part time notary publics lend or rent notary seal to service personnel of notary offices .
as for the number of people against the law like this
should n't be in the foul atomsphere with notarial deed made by the fake greffiers
i think there should be a special legislation
crime of greffier lending or leasing greffier signature stamp
is there a reply from a legal expert ?
for example the smallest province : hainan province , should be a small province , easy to investigate
should only have a few cities and counties , easy to investigate
on earth , how many part-time greffiers are leasing or renting greffier signature stamps ?
it is very easy to come to the conclusion . it is easy to do with the investigation results

what reasons there are ?
once a bowl of american donkey soup ingested , he will be strictly obedient to the americans , with a sweet and innocent sycophant face
tell me what places in china were invaded by the united states
if the americans stop the soups
you think that usa attacked japan was to help china . ha !
you think that usa inspect china every day is to let us understand ourselves more . ha !
so united states technology sanction is for us to maintain the good tradition of being thrifty .
so united states requested renminbi increase value is to increase chinese commoners ' international purchasing power
first responder , my post has gone . i just stay here to listen to your reasons . tell me why you are against usa ?
as long as you are rational i will go with you to oppose usa .
is that to help japan ?
reply to 9th thread above . i cannot list out . you do it .
you cannot give things to other people , why on earth they should give things to you ?
people say wise people have iq of 120 , yours must be more than double of it
it is not appropriate , that 's why the us president apologized for it and made a compensation !
does it in fact impede china 's peaceful reunification process
4 , do you believe , in the us trade with china , is everything all fair ?
in reply to post #14 if you have a reason , say it well , if you do n't , stop talking nonsense
it was for itself
when doing business what is considered fair ?
do you have standards ?
if you want to spend more money then it 's your own business !
taiwan relation case , objectively does it cause any harm to the feelings of chinese people
the republic of china is also china !
professor 55 , did you see my question ?
did you see my question ?
is n't it always about you ?
a little more than you !
i 'm still using that analogy : ignorant , shameless , no reason
do n't you think that in the alliance against fascist countries , china 's resistance was a contribution to the world anti-fascist struggle ?
what other reasons are there ?
these above mentioned are not reasons !
so the us has helped china , does that mean it can do whatever it wants to china ?
speak clear !
i have heard too much of this bullshit , some people live on it . i have no comment on if i admit it or not . i have expressed my opinion on your view ...
if the united states helped japan , cannot they carve up china the same way
please read carefully my entire question , do you want to change the topic
34th post the us has helped china , then it has the right to abuse china ?
ask you is it or not , please answer yes or no
but did the us do this ?
maybe the united states , after helping china , seized the opportunity to stay and occupy china , which can also be a reason to be against the united states
what i was saying is to suppose : after the united states helped china , they took the opportunity to stay and occupy china , which can also be a reason to be anti - america .
who is on duty ?
do n't take your comments out of context
on what basis ?
i 'm asking you yes or no , please reply yes or no .
for example , the complete question is like this , please do n't cut the sentence .
it seems you are getting serious , you also could not think of many reasons !
with your identity , do n't you know that it is under what kind of circumstance
since it is an apology , then you agree that it is a reason to be anti-american
based on experiences , such kind of discussion on almost secret issues is not to brew a reform , but an omen of abortion
such extraordinary issues , without extraordinary boldness , who can seal the deal ?
and in the short run , harm over benefit .
the key factor is to step out of the first step is very difficult , possibly have many resistance .
since sooner or later we need to make the move , if possible , why do n't we take this opportunity and try to proceed with precaution
did n't we say need major cultural development ?
just followed two posted disappeared in a flash of eye , host started to pondering .
deleting posts is not promoting the culture
uncivilized posts should be deleted , personal slanderous attacks and offensive languages do n't count as civilized does it , you can check out how much garbage there is in this forum , in dire need of your grand entrance , to clean up in person .
you ca n't offer any of your opinions and yet you call yourself an outstanding moderater ?
do n't laugh , there 's no where to express anger so the only thing to do is to insult them .
this is known as responding to calling , flourishing culture , would understand more by reading lots of newspaper
in china , everyone learns from corrupt official , salute to prostitutes ;
actually would be better to go play the flute to cows .
can you delete posts ?
everything is your model ?
it is useless , even if opposition 's writing is graceful .
you speak the reasoning in this .
your life this cycle does n't have any hope , next life you need to hope that guan guan will be just like you , could n't find an appropriate partner .
guan guan will not bend over , you can just have a soliloquy .
do not reveal it ! if you reveal yourself the lower class people will trample you to death .
your heart only has ability to yell on the street , how much more can you do ?
you think pariah you are numerous ?
seeing the insanity of this malformed society , maybe it would be better to go home and see the wild cat on the roof , maybe it really can get a little peace and happiness in return .

leader of the post is discussing tiger 's skin with tiger !
i really do n't think so . web manager is restrickted by others . more or less he is educated .

you can seriously go up to the roof to see the stray cat ?
in present chinese society , good people are not numerous , bad people are also a minority , majority of people are like to floor owner , that are not good or bad , just passing by time .
in the current chinese society , good guys are not abundant , while bad guys are the minority too . common idling people like the thread owner who are neither good or bad account for the majority
people created history . it did n't need good people or bad people . is that right ?
let 's talk about something else . too much complain cause nobody coming .
a. democratic socialism .
c. scientifical socialism
cannot talk about the first three socialisms ?
actually , i do n't need to talk about it much . everybody knows a typical national socialism . it is nazi .
the country is an absolute thing , while every individual and group is relative . the country is the reflection of individual true rationality and free will , so individuals must absolutely obey the country
democratic socialism supports diversified economic development , and requires the country to provide good welfare and redistribute fortune .
the principle content of the democratic socialism : propagate diversity on the theoretic basis and advocate the abandonment of a unified world view .
which of three previous types of socialism is the most similar to scientific socialism , without culture still understands .
there was a social doctrine that had not developed .
lastly , united together , united to show compassion to those who are suffering from injustice and unequal treatment .
whose state is it in state socialism ?
one just ran away , laowu 's heart is broken , which is that qaddafi
china today , lie is gold , truth and honesty on the other hand is stupid .
ca n't distinguish good versus bad , good people might need to sit in jail , bad people then enjoy blossom and wine ;
you have caught how many frauds and thieves ?
ca n't become a mainstream politician so you just have to bark here .
you cannot tell good from bad . good people may be put in jail . you have not been it 's because you are not brave enough .
... family 's woman dreams to enjoy good life without earning it . on the other hand , the man wants to get profits without any investment . go figure who is so shameless in this forum .
government officials collude with business men to get rich together .
october 22 of this year , a talk in shenyang revealed the crisis that the chinese government was facing economic bankrupt and the illness was beyond cure
the key point of his talk was that the economic data of china from online to offline were all forged
he blatantly stated : the economy of the country is gravely ill , that 's the reason that nothing had permission to be reported , cause everything was negative .
lang xianping commented : this is fake .
right now , all chinese governmental policies are trying to cover this problematic economy .
he also predicted that chinese financial tsunami will surface in 2013 , because by that time , the banks can no longer survive
the us is building up a big dam to block chinese economic tsunami .
hey buddy .
no wonder the us is promoting the trans-pacific partnership in this year 's apec .
you changed icon again , you should be happy now .
according to economy observer 's field study , it shows the garment industry in jiangsu and zhejiang province is operating at a rate of
a couple years ago , i already did n't believe the gdp number
you really feel good of yourself .
it is even worse that the chinese total power capacity is 0.916 billion kw , but now the generating rate is only 40 %
however , all the major cities in china are short on electricity , how could that be ?
areas including guizhou , yunnan , shanxi and so on are all short on electricity .
lang xianping said that railroads , highways , and airports themselves have no profits . after they are built they cannot create wealth .
taiwanese call this [ mosquito hall ] , constructions built for feeding mosquitoes .
in fact is already bankrupt !
you are japanese ?
i am chinese !
china 's gdp comprises of 70 % steel and concrete , ca n't utilize benefits , need china 's manufacturing industry provide taxes to exchange with dollar .
if the western countries are all broke , a world war will break out
this is a fundamental violation of the natural operating law of economics
at that time , what the soviet union relied on to pay the costs were petroleum and natural gas export to earn foreign currency , there were 30 billion us dollars every year , but the united states blocked the petroleum exploration technology and natural gas pipelines
at the end , taking advantage of the crude production raise from the middle east , the crude oil price fell from 35 dollar per tank to 12 dollar , in addition to the 25 % dollar depreciation
probably it is more ...
if chinese economy grows at a negative rate , it will have to sell the us debt to save itself
china does not have money to buy fruits . that is bad to the farmers in taiwan .
it 's like this ...
the us-japanese strategic planning
intelligence originates from universal love
i already said that in 2006 that dual economic structure caused the fake prosperity of economy . crisis is coming !
now the chinese economy , carrying old sickness and new wounds , is standing in front of heaven in 2012 , will it turn left or right ?

therefore it cannot solve any problem , nothing but a self-promoting campaign by way of an alarming story
take iron ore as another example , by june 20 , iron ores piled up at chinese ports reached as high as 98.90 million tons , exceeding the 70.98 million tons at the time of the last financial crisis
for life , can you do business with losses
it is also why so hard to choose this way
these state-owned enterprises ' revenue is almost zero , including the interest on the capital , it is even more difficult to imagine
the law is : crisis , recession , recovery and growth , again and again in a cycle !
what you said are two different concepts .
the law of market has its own limitations .
this does n't need to be explained
what about taiwan petroleum ?
is it government or privately owned ?
petroleum has both government and privately owned companies
there are both state-owned and private enterprises in taiwan 's financial industry
private enterprises did n't go bankruptcy , do you think which one is superior , which one is inferior ?
for example , the industrial and commercial bank of china is ranked at the top of the world !
it 's because i do n't understand taiwan , this is why i have to ask you !
for example , the world top 500 , how many does taiwan have ?
congratulations to our country 's marine time unmanned aircraft first east sea cruise
my main consideration is it should be both safe and not provoking other countries

now , assad is walking on the road of saddam and kadafi step by step .
regarding the syria issue , under the circumstances of not losing demeanor , russian attitude entirely emphasizes the interests of russia in syria , but not supporting and protecting assad .
victims of transferring economic crisis
aircraft carriers of the united states and russia fall over each other to sail to syria
if the international society decides to use force against syria , the strategy that russia will adopt must be occupying one important unit in syria .
russia invited syria government 's opponent for a talk . even russian does not truly support al-assad , which other country want to sacrifice for syria ?
it does not matter if al-assad is president or not , syria will pay the cost .
reason one
russia is hoping that the syrian government and rebels can peacefully settle the crisis through conversations
putin defected so quickly
mao zedong maniac volunteers went over , waving the red book in hand , that will be ok
good thing
reason two
if the main and side relation with syria is good , the russians , will not have talks to the syrian opposition
it takes this chance to have a cup of cola in syria . other than that , there are some other possibilities .
in any case , russia is not protecting syria , it 's not protecting assad .
only china can save syria now
i hope the arab league and syria , from the perspective of protecting the fundamental interestes of syrian people , peaceful and stable environment in the middle east , and avoiding external interference , enhance communication and coordination in order to put an end to the syria crisis and properly solve related problems .
first , syria must accept the interference of its domestica affairs by the arab league
thirdly , syria should work with the arab union to properly solve the related issues , and from the perspective of safeguarding the fundamental interests of syrian people and peaceful and stable environment of the middle east , should avoid external interferences
the speaker from the department of foreign affairs hong lei expressed on 28th that the problem in syria should be resolved under the frame of arabia allies . that will benefit syria , arabia countries , international society .
regarding libya issue , russia did not acknowledge the rebels now did they acknowledge the executive , i did not pay attention to russia 's attitude .
libya , syria , iran , china , russia
on the current status of syria , some chinese people only like to fantasize , they think russian aircraft carriers and warships have gone to syria , if china and russia collaborate syria can be protected .
one , russia wo n't go to protect syria
thirdly , even if you china voluntarily offer to collaborate with russia to confront the united states and nato , russia will not collaborate with you .
the basis of the issue between china and russia is the differences in political systems , their president must follow rules to do things .
now , in regards to syria issue , only russia gets benefited , continues to sell weapons to al-asad .
that is russia . can chinese government compare with russia 's ?
ha ha ha , do n't forget if there were just china and russia two strong countries china will be destroyed eventually .
no matter how strongly russia opposes to penalize syria and to get involved militarily , russia will not have a military conflict with usa and nato on the issue about syria .
it seems that syria agrees to accept inspectors from arabic allies .
even if arabic allies ' inspectors can accomplish their mission , it does not mean there is a good turning point on the syria issue .
on the internets there are people asking why chinese are anti - american . it 's not funny , who are you anyway ?
besides , after ww2 , who was the one who allied with japan ? it was n't china .
talking about yi zi repayment thing is even more funny , at the time eight hooligans raped your mom , just because one hooligan left a wild seed like you , your mom is going to be thankful ?

such as steel , petroleum , coal , weapons , ammunitions , and so on . in the mean time , increased the supply to china
according to marxist theory , money is a universal equivalent , no matter right or wrong . if thy love the property , seek for it properly . as long as you do not disobey the law and morals , loving money has nothing wrong
in an authority society , if authority is not limited , authority and money will collude to seek personal gain by abusing authority
and steve jobs is rich too !
no one will think the money they got is illegitimate
one world , two systems , peaceful co-existence and never starting wars against each other , china can do it
our principle regarding international relations , is not to ransack/plunder , but mutual benefits , if china becomes wealthy , it will help world poor to become wealthy through preferential trade policy .
still first public display carnivores 's wealth .
pretend to be the third grandson internationally , then bully own countryman , is animal !
say some real things , what use will cussing do ?
suppress even people of the same ancestor and same ethnicity , let alone other ethnicities ?
it is not equal in your own country . you promote equality in the world . not powerful enough to plunder in the world so it plunder its own citizens .
publicizing wealth is a time issue . if you were a government official will you plunder ?
it has been talked about for a few dozen years . is it still a time question ?
if the americans really plunders our country , i will firmly support to unify and defend foreign enemies , but you should not be unable to defend outside but instead deal with the low-level civillians inside the country and more intensively oppress them
how do we unite and defend foreign enemies

even lu xun said these people who always accuse traitors are not positive personnel .
then is national issues .
but to blame foreign devil all the time , that shows this person has problems .
that does not match with normal human behaviors .
you treat it seriously every day , endlessly risk your life to fight him , to kill traitors
either they have ulterior motives , or they just want to give vent
it also reflects their patriotism
rather , it is this kind of people are made for traitors
he will find a reason , survival first
he does not give a shit on what 's happening in front of him
because they were closer to him ,
that matches the logic of this kind of people .
who are you ? do i need to explain ?
i always want to understand
killing , robbing , or raping
it cannot be understood to be traitor .
of course , you do n't understand . if you understand you will not argue with other people .

this [ sporty wind ] no.21 hopped out himself admitting he 's a traitor .
why do chinese people hate traitors ?
if there were no traitors nobody would hate traitors .
that was because there were many .
comparing with many other nationalities in the world there are similar type of people as chinese traitors .
because of development and prosperity in china
every foreign force that enters china must rely on home soil 's power to implement administration .
i really do n't understand , all are leftists and angry youth , but here you you always make personal comments every time he speaks , and subsequently curses each other , if others curse back he will stick labels fiercely
in china , most true traitors were intelectuals .
when japanese created a puppet government in china at that time
they could not be at top levels .

meaning certain behavior even though should receive punishment , but many people already done it , then ca n't really use punishment as a way to deal with the situation .
no matter how you explain it , it is the fundamental reason for deteriorating morality .

check out yourself who is the suspect here ?
i 'll tell you there are such things in real life .
it is originally a good policy to develop social welfare , and make people lead a decent life . there is no ground for blame .
the 30 years after the end of world war ii , are brilliant 30 years with high-speed economic development in western europe .
but till the first oil crisis in 1970 's , a few european countries , especially france have started to decline .
at the same time , high benefits , high spending model is still on going .
after the president came onto the stage , ignoring the emptiness of the treasury , buying popularity through debts , realize promises
the result of the competition of two parties is economical crisis , sky-high debt , increasing unemployment rate , struggling poor , doom in disguise ( as blessing )
elites , the society is developing , theories are continuously innovated , the democratic pattern cannot be ossified only as capitalism democracy .
democracy can guaranty the validity of law . democracy can guaranty human rights and basic free specking rights . democracy can guaranty social supervision . democracy corrects action mistakes ...
it is a country 's obligation to provide high welfare to its people , but it cannot be in the form of positive and negative liabilities , but to levy higher taxes on rich people
it 's said that capitalism countries ' welfare policy is to apply socialism ideas .
traditional country is a pure violent mechanism . it traditional country is a pure violent mechanism . it violently controls its people internally . it violently defends and expands its territory externally . the most important meaning of thinking enlighten is to change this concept .
therefore , there is nothing wrong with democracy .
that is a market relationship .
mercenary relationship is capitalism , not democracy
a country not only needs leftists to guarantee the motives of revolution , but also needs rightists to guarantee consistency and stability

their americans are indeed selfish
therefore , in the world , the united states has no public appeal
treat own country as garbage , become a good person abroad , foreigners would also despise this kind of country .
investigate the reason , punish if should be punished , correct if need to be correct , correct completely .
more so no need to think them america this and that .
those americans at least they did n't start remodeling offices in the end of year , distribute public funds , buy luxury cars , form groups to travel with public funds , just do n't have money to buy school buses !

it is not that i am so smug
this is in the recent years , the most foolish thing the americans had said .
reflected the smallest hostile toward people of china 's abnormal and arrogant act of endangering people of china .
reveal obama 's ' we do n't fear china '
all signs indicate the enemy is firing shots and charging us
what we can not understand is , without a population of 1.3 billion , in such a country , there is no one dares to strike back against obama
how come no one in china dares to say , we are not afraid of obama
actually when obama said we are not afraid of china , this is not the voice of all americans , on the contrary , this is just the arrogance of a few people , such as obama
china is not afraid of obama
if doubt about it , let 's look at the development of history : obama 's days are the tail of a rabbit : ca n't be long
on the contrary , china is not afraid of obama
only a few people too arrogant to believe that obama is not afraid of china
american imperialism never stops the attempt to destroy china
south china sea islands are occupied , nobody dares to say a word
the question is very simple . what america wants to destroy are those countries that do not obey them . it does not care if this country is democratic or not .
for instance , a few days ago , its secretary of state provoked some other countries to against china in an unrelated event .
armed force along with internal use of contradiction and brain - washing the world 's virtue in order to stir up trouble , carrots plus whipping stick , that is how good old americans ' method to dominate the world .
however , a good hope is not what the american imperialism thinks
transgenic good and bill gates sterile vaccines are for the common chinese people , right

-no ?
our determination to destroy us is still not dead , we are the same .
if this is not the case , let 's make it happen .
us newsweek published an article on its website on november 28th titled overseas balance becomes obama 's diplomatic strategy .
when the united states has lots of money in hand and feels confident to its military strength it will give up the balance strategy . when its money and threaten measures were used up it will go back to it oversea balance strategy .

what america imperialists want to destroy are those countries that do not obey them .
the answer is negative !
are the countries in the middle east so ?
is libya in north africa so ?
what does destroy mean ?
destroy the communism , this communism is just a word ?
how to ruin ?
is the sky missing in china ?
has the mountains , rivers , and animals disappeared ?
what to be ruined ?
the americans would say , hey , my kindness is repaid with hatred , i want the chinese people to have democracy , it can prevent corruption ?
people have the votes , then to become an official , need to gain favor and be mindful of the people then can be a good public servant ?
how come the chinese people take kindness as donkey liver ?
today , the countries that want to destroy us are india , vietnam , and philippine . attack these three countries are important . we need to make friends from far and attack neighbors .
i only need to fight against three countries . if i invite usa to become the 4th opponent i am a fool unless usa joins itself in to become the 4th one .
may i ask : do america imperialists have an ambition to destroy us ?
although there are many stupid people in china there are more clear-headed people .
talking about the democracy , freedom and human rights , this concept has too faces in the belief of americans : internal and external
of course , you can borrow those good stuff people invented .

what strategic significance does it have ?
support it to fly , and still support
this is really insane
also should show great sorrow , shake the body , grovel on the ground to show loyalty

the poor people endorse mao , and the rich people oppose mao , which is not surprising
good and honest people support mao , evil people oppose mao , this is not strange .
mao - asses are just brainless , donkey - headed animals !
equating tens of thousands of people 's dedication and sacrifice and with one person 's achievement is in itself uninspiring , even more blatant !
reply to post 18 , it seems that mao was n't the very first one to bring up revolution in china ?
this is shameful and absurd !
for a person 's fame and interest , sealing everyone 's mouth , how pathetic , contemptible , and unimaginative this is !
the development of a country itself will have the poor and the rich
revise : to reply the 23rd post , delegate the crap , i am now a typical poor guy , what rich people 's benefit do i represent ?
the proletarians want a revolution , beat up the landlords , divide up the gold , is that right or wrong .
reply to the post on 24th floor , fuck you , just make your own money , how do you split the money you have now ?
a political system without democracy and transparency , you and me and everyone are waiting to be screwed !
but you are clear , for anything to succeed there must be a good leader , otherwise nothing will be achieved .
seldom three descents continue poor . seldom three descents continue rich . if being poor or rich were eternal , the society would not last , and the time will fall back

to reply the 32nd post ,
do you dare to ask that ?
just come to my place and get some trainings
therefore , they added two characters that means special in front of socialism . chongqing moved one step forward based on that special socialism . if it succeeds other places will do the same .
man has practice needs in life , everyone wants to live a good life , except mao , because he just cannot put up with anyone living a good life .
reply to the post on 32nd floor , you should tell these to those senior officers , you just tell them , should you guys spare some money and power for us ?
do you know how much money those senior officers have ?
if their rights were for the people , we must protect , if it does not match with people 's interest , you can get online to make recommendation , i deeply believe it would be changed .
reply to the post on 34th floor , all people want their life get better and better . this is the desire and and life desire in human nature , do n't you ever have the same feeling ?
dare you say this is not the display of greed ?
this is nonsense , is n't it ?
we will naturally sympathize with people who have the similar or same experiences as our own , this is actually what you meant by kindness .
man has sense and sensibility , sense is acquired , whereas sensibility is born with .
it is because of human 's greedy and hypocritical nature that leads us to get together to discuss , to make a law that is fair to everybody . this law should limit every person 's overreaction to something .
to reply the 39th post , human nature is sinful , this is actually easy to understand .
this is in fact a reflection of the evil humanity
where is my post ?
thus you have to put everything into consideration .
my children whom i teach by myself , follow the law , work hard as a human being , do n't participate in crooked means , except from teaching them how to be a human being , because i have never given them benefits .
opposing dictation and autocracy is correct .
bravo

i now can be classified as boring as well , although only lightly not to the point to harm others much , should still be normal
#19 listless people must have shameless behavior . does this sentence make sense logically ?
old huai , what should be added ?
arise !
hehe , what you are doing is not only boring , but also extremely boring
boredom , commoners see often and cause no harm ; to breed harm from boredom , that is the harm of boredom .
[ current affairs debate ] a bored / boring person is bound to exhibit shameless behaviors
only those who fight for survival , for dignity , for ideal have the right to comment on life . if one strives for lies , for power , for status should not comment on others , because that will be nonsense

huaxi village , why you are getting further away from us ?
reduce jobless rate ?
maybe , neither of them .
increase gdp , i also say , the country also changes the concept . will the gdp go up by transporting steel from north to south ?
is n't it the input greater than the output
occasionally cultivate someone like wu renbao , a hundred million good qualities , exceptional rural officials .
we just hope and wish , china can never make it , even in 10 thousand years
you do n't understand the situation in china , why on earth the us has a red budget book when it is so rich ?
people are divided into 3 , 6 , and 9 classes . central village is first class . other villages are second class . people from outside are third class .
previous one yuan now is 10 yuan , why ?
let me make an analogy . i think the current china is how much coal is produced , how many things can be accomplished . so now we massively import petroleum
does not deserve a discussion
is n't there enough political tilt on xiaogang village ?
common prosperity does not mean everyone should be equally wealthy , it does not mean egalitarianism
should someone working for 10 years have the same salary as another one working for only 1 year ?
in democratic uk , in democratic japan , their queen and their mikado are not just first-class people , but also hereditary first-class people .
should be based on honest work , reasonable profiting is right , ca n't use shortcuts and jump through loopholes in regulation .
anyways the domestic market share is only this big , you took a little more , other people would take a little less .
the time of competition of family background is good indeed !
huaxi village is a fake advertisement , not worth mentioning
use your brain to think , not your ass to think of problems
hundreds of thousands of villages nationwide , if every village get billions of funding , how much funding there has to be

how much carbon is released per person in huaxi ? if 600 million farmers release carbon by this standard what the earth will be ? from environmental viewpoint , huaxi 's experience cannot be extended .
huaxi is a special case . it cannot be extended .

in a society if only a minority of wealthy people receive excessive rewards and benefits , it only instigates the inevitable downfall of the society , if everyone becomes wealthy lawfully through hard work , only then can there be long lasting collective prosperity .
the basis of morality and honesty , is the judgement and recognition of right and wrong of people , the mainstream ideology determines the content and level of the general crowd 's morality and honesty
for instance , once the standards of right and wrong regarding making fortune by working and getting benefits through cunning tricks have a dubious boundary from the past , it will be easy to trigger the conscious misunderstanding of using any means in the economic life
therefore , the mainstream judging standard of object values of a society cannot be underestimated
haha , new round up screen flashing started ?
response : 1 , the result overall has progressive meanings .
third , this is the meaning of the emphasis on both the construction of legal system and cultural education , strengthening citizen 's education , developing prosperous mainstream culture .

those of you , deceived civilians , those who spared no effort yelling downfall the gang of four and singing loudly the song of spring story , later were either off the job or out of work , or died of illness .
since the downfall of the gang of four , those used to have no food to eat from the big pot could eat braised pork in soy sauce , after eating braised pork in soy sauce , they sang the story of spring
did civil servants have to get free food in public institutions ?
after the reform and opening - up , people were getting rich . enterprise employees had good stuff to eat .
chinese people always value the etiquette
but you should n't keep and steal
the privileged food for the privileged class , spending little , ample amount , nutritionally sound .
look at their jobs , you will understand a lot too

who say there is no free lunch in the world
why you ask this while knowing the answer !
first of all , i have to clarify that . they are not trying to get a free dinner , they are provided with the free meal as a privilege . usually , they are not willing to eat it .

at that time not only there was n't one case of aids , all stds were extinct
perhaps that type of virus has n't been discovered yet
tons of rich people are immigrating to the us , are they gonna infected with hiv
he died 5 days after the onset of the disease
since the first case in china in june 1985 , until october 2011 , the aids infections in our country has accumulated to 440 thousand cases .
baidu baike : the aids was only confirmed in us in 1981 .
mao zedong will never let aids get into china .
since 1980s , sexually transmitted diseases once again started to appear in china
in the middle 1960s , with the elimination of syphilis , gonorrhea was also extinct .
mid 60s
gonorrhea was extinct

are blowing with the spring breeze of prostitution all the time .
this is the happy climax brought by deng xiaoping , the architect
one day , the prostitute was caught . the police scolded : why did you prostitute ?
when i relied on the factory the factory was sold . i have that small spot . it does not require much time and can make some quick money . i do not embezzle and not corrupted .
i sold my body but kept my spirit . there still is a hole after you pull out a radish . how can you say this is selling ?
a policeman said loudly : do you know your crime ?
no noise no pollution , using thin seam promoting development ,
this line is classic .
replying he is laughing in hell !
the government officials now can enjoy prostitution if they want to , are proud of it
not called prostitution , it 's called male female relationship problems

post #38 by beauty monk
your mom is a prostitute
nonsense , bullshit
the first case of hiv positive was found in 1981
it is so vicious to blame the reform and opening up for the introduction of aids
china found aids in 1985
if we do n't pretend to be grandsons , can we acquire sovereign right of the south sea and u.s. would no longer tie us up ?

a citizen has the responsibility to abide the laws and has the right to break the laws at the same time , breaking of laws should receive punishments .
then , who can determine speech is unlawful without judgement from the court ?
china is a nation , is a nation of all the people , it has laws and legislations .
just like talking about technical problems of missiles with a missile expert , you have been complaining that you do n't have freedom of speech for all this time !
the corrupted ones have been plundering plenty , ca n't we at least talk about them
who can censor speech ?
it has always been servants who can limit masters ' speech statements .
corrupt officials can limit speech rights , because they do n't allow you to talk about their corruption .
is it the laws ?
it 's the assets ?
law is in the hands of every citizen , are corrupted officials more powerful than you , with one more arm ? none of such , why should we be in fear .
freedom of speech ?
even if you have some freedom occasionally , sorry , they would not implement it .
the chinese history makes me understand that only those people who can cheat win the world , and those who make fakes win the money .

foreigner chatting : china ignored the way of escape arranged by philippine 's previous president arroyo .
unique viewpoint !
they do n't even have a way of escape for themselves . how can they bother somebody else 's way of escape ?
both sides want to drive the other ( the brother ) out during the conflict/combat , to dominate by oneself
a few dozen years later and thought through all the bad things that happened , they should understand that everything will prosper when there is peace in the family . they will be taken advantage of if the family is divided .
the two brothers must give up some of their previous hobbies for the sake of bigger family .
otherwise how can two brothers make up
past experiences should be carried forward by two brothers and get to a greater height
if we never froget what we did correct or wrong previously how two brothers make peace again ?
it 's easy to say but hard to operate .
the second is in april 2006 , president ahmadinejad spoke in public that , israel will be destroyed soon , and the whole middle east area will be liberated .
ahmadinejad has this idea to establish islamic zone in the middle east
he is so shameless
this is typical robber 's tone
surgical strike will teach ahmadinejad a lesson , but wo n't have an all-out war . it should be the air forces leading by israel , the united states and nato who take the mission of bombing
in the country of iran , the religious leader khamenei is the supreme leader of this country . the president ahmadinejad is not the supreme leader
religious leader khamenei is the supreme leader of iran and the commander in chief of armed forces
this system has a deadly weakness that the survival of the religious leader ( the survival of khamenei ) has a significant influence on iran .
hehehe , when iran nuclear facilities are indeed destroyed , which countries will send troops to assist iran ?
when the international atomic energy agency wants to publish iran atomic problem , it was fiercely accused by khamenei , further demonstrating iran 's atomic material and facility is not for civilian use .
if they do n't thoroughly destroy nuclear weapons facilities , the international society will clean it up in time
no matter how khamenei and nejad said they would revenge and retaliate , when iran is really attacked khamenei and nejad and others who shouted for a world war will be frightened .
is it eaten again ?
ahmadinejad did a domestic gathering , and gave a speech at the gathering on being not afraid of military strikes
now israel has made a clear stand that it will have military strikes
when time comes nejad will know the elegance of israel 's air force .
do i need to bump ?
now , israel stated that they will have a military strike . when time comes nejad will know the elegance of israel 's air force .
these words are defending iran
who else ?
if all middle east countries do not get involved how can there be a crisis ?
which countries in middle east are willing to support iran militarily or support iran to fight back against israel ?
is china , who opposes military action against iran , gonna help iran strike back using its own military power ?
is russia gonna intervene in military action against iran ?
mahmoud ahmadinejad was right , military attack against iran was not only a military problem , but a political problem .
this statement makes it very clear that this is not just a military problem , but also a political problem .
now , what else can you say khamenei and ahmadinejad ?
doing this is beneficial to all parties .
on november 20th , 2011 ... iran air force exposed its battle force by saying it could destroy israel by using four missiles .
iran is very important , it has very important resources and strategic channel strait of hormuz
if you say this is for civilian use , you could open up all suspicious facilities and let international society make a nuclear inspection .
to avoid violence .
the truth reveals that iran now is not afraid of any country , it thinks it is the strongest , and has important strategic position .
i think lebanon has overdone it , and iran has gone wrong on strategy .
iran leading organization 's belief has determined that iran cannot continue to be that egotistical .
irananian parliament voted to decrease the diplomatic and trading relations with the uk on the 27th of local time , will banish the british ambassador dominick chilcott .
france has established ambassador-level relations with iran .
the us does not have a embassy in iran
france also call for freezing of iran central bank assets
i estimate it will be so
hehe , this speech is nothing new , there has been this kind of speech in some country before
britain withdrew all the personnel from its embassy . that indicates they are planning a new strategy .
since english embassy personnel evacuated , short term will not return again .
iran now can only go against the wind , warning european countries not to support and participate in the punishments to iran , otherwise it will induce the hatred from iranian people .
bai shuping should retire soon , and speed up money collection . what can be done ? the atmosphere of society has been ruined

you see by doing bad , how famous have i become !
so this society 's education now is teaching people to stop right and engage in wrong , how could this be !
therefore , to conceal one 's faults while praising one 's virtue should be practiced by our buddhist followers . evil people will be rewarded with evil . there is no need for us to proclaim it
to conceal one 's faults while praising one 's virtue has some effects , but it is not a good prescription to cure all diseases
it is comfortable in the mouth , but slipped in the brain

if the massacre really happened as the government planned murdering the people , and we voted against it , this is nothing different than help king zhou for abuse .
ye zhou 's prediction : either the euro zone collapses and rises from the ashes , or the economy will be in a long - turn downturn . no matter what it turns out to be , the disaster in europe is inevitable .
it looks like that , [ the disbandment of the euro area ] , may be the final result .
the issue of the euro zone is a political issue , not an economic issue
economic assistance is to treat the symptoms but not the disease , which wo n't be of any hope

china and taiwan can only live and die together !
as long as this point is understood !
understanding is a wise man , a wise man can turn bad luck into good fortune !
firstly , deny the existence of the republic of china , because one china , two representations still has a china
but if it is required by the reality , he will also temporarily acknowledge it , and then slowly correct it .
that is to say china and taiwan have nothing to do with each other , everything should be taiwan 's .
she used something that seems rational to package taiwan independence .
there is no need for any of this
because her core is taiwan independence .
change it in the name of legitimacy .
then so what about common view , everyone knows , unless with military force , there 's no turning back .
even the things she objects to herself .

the us did gave a great help to china during the world war ii , we should respect this historical fact
in order for the american troops to strike japanese invaders , chinese army and civilians also made great selfless contributions or even used life to trade for the safety of the american troops
objectively speaking , the relationship between china and the us has become codependent and competitive at the same time because of the differences in standard of value and international relations for a long time .
the friendship existed between china and the us in history , cannot be a reason for china willing to bear the insult and the damage of chinese people 's interest caused by the us

tsai ing-wen never mentioned mainland , all she talked about is china , because she wants to differentiate taiwan
since she is 100 % taiwan 's pro - independence , then if she wins the office , should we start using the anti-secession law
under what other conditions should the anti-secession law be applied ?
is n't that deceiving oneself as well as others ?
then it is no longer her problem , it is your problem now , right ?
this is acceptable , please let me ask why do we need the anti-secession law
and who is responsible for it ?

after the seventh army was destroyed , your dad gave up to the liberation army and became a liberation soldier , right ?

these days the incidence of kong qingdong 's insane remarks is a hot topic online . all media seem to show a gesture of a common hatred .
in this incident , kong really has not handled well .
when media 's power or influence , focused and given to an individual , power ca n't avoid more or less become violence .
originally when looking at the title alone , i was thinking why snow wolf got his feet wet
over eighty media , big or small , all swarmed out to encircle kong monk
looks like , they should all receive kong monk 's three mother 's teaching
he can cuss mothers , other people also can , who is afraid of whom
i do n't support monk hong at all , i only think media put the fucus on something pointless spot .
hong is only is singing bird
but when get online occasionally , will find overwhelming stories about monk kong
these media companies are same party different steps , intentions are obvious
however famous old kong is
pushing a common professor on this scale
this is true !
how come no media was hopping out then ?
swore a few lines of curses
obviously is susceptible of bullying
in fact , is there anyone who does n't swear / curse in this world ?
tanzhi , feitian , the two of you , you two , do n't lead my post into the sewer
is n't it as continuous as a thread that the national curses such as bitch
ai n't i trying to extend your ideas accordingly ?
alright , snow wolf , enough for the chitchat , let 's get back to the main story
snow wolf , to be honest , i have never given any opinion on the topic of monk kong
performing duties mindlessly on their post , teachers are like this , blindly replicating exam - taking machines , the media workers are the same , blindly following the political trend .
who then can keep / guard their bottom line of conscience , morality , justice , and civilized direction

capitalism united states ' wealth based distribution will definitely cause periodically fiance production become excessive .
you really treated united states as communism society ?
replying 10th floor 's post distribute based on power 's basis is : base on distributive non - product resources to distribute based on resources !
you say a little bit , how long are each of these two histories .
going to extremes on any direction is a dangerous signal to lead people astray
this is natural principles , does not change based on human minds !
friendly reminder : eat more gelatin mornings and nights , powerful pill first class supplement .
distribution based on resources is more reasonable than big pot sharing .
actually , china is capital-based distribution .
when the conditions are ready for need-based distribution but not operated that way will inevitably cause the waste of resources .
what does the thread owner need
what do we ourselves need , who also knows ?
but this kind of distributions must have a limit , which means must avoid the big gap in polarization to appear
agree !

everyone wants beautiful woman , big house , car , money , but there are so many people in the world , there ca n't be enough resource .

the chinese people fundamentally lack the spirit of asking questions about truth and right and wrong . ever since they stood up ( note : 1949 ) they have gradually lost their spirit . i wonder why ?
moreover , whatever they do need to be discussed and agreed by the party group and negotiated and voted as a group . you cannot send a crowd of people to capture the officials of the entire county .
the hooligans are beaten once losing powerful protections , while corrupted officials are caught once losing the political game .
correct summary , incisive
actually officials are all patriotic
the first thing they think of is the country
finally they think of themselves
whose fault it is , think hard for yourself . do n't you really understand ?

this question is well raised .
we have seen that when a society is in a week atmosphere of the common spirit , it will stay in an extensive developmental frame
which means diversification is an essential road to social development .
is it because fan jie is more competent that other female officials ?
as to becoming a standing committee member , some people say she is too young , i do n't think so , as long as she is capable it 's ok .
say she is capable ?
say she is really competent ?
say she is talented ?
when we asked , we learned that she was abandoned by her children , and the prosperous zhenzhen government ignored it completely
what kind of society is this , senior citizens are not taken care of !

if it goes on like this , the united states will easily hand over its painstakingly - obtained status as the international overlord . the united states will inevitably follow the steps of the great britain and become a fading empire . the loss outweighs the gain
compared with the total decline of the us , it means nothing .
what we get in return is the realization of the global multi-polarization . it is a huge success . this is what we want to get strategically .
at this time , the united states said something like use taiwan for exchange of us government debt . it 's very absurd .
taiwan is a part of china , either from the history or from the international law , it is an integral part of china .
their choices are quite limited , either bracing the full decline , becoming a second-class country like uk , or lead the world together with china .
i am going to tell you this is impossible .

provided assistance a total of 7.5 billion to pakistan , however have caused direct economical damage reaching 6.8-6.9 billion
united states this kind of country relies on looting and reconstruction , relies on war to develop , could actually represent justice ...
you can reveal some secrets for show .
open eyes to look , open ears to listen , use heart to think .
deposing china , destroying culture , losing territory , and worship foreign things .
it leads to that in the future china cannot be united and more and more people lost consensus and common agreement . this is becoming a vicious cycle .
worship everything from overseas .
private scholarship overflows , dang pai reigns supreme
easy destruction
the hundreds times easier destruction
this kind of national status is too bone - chilling!
position in country leadership to use their talent .
a
can condemn a holy man
banks can only sell to foreign strategic capitalists , which will totally destroy the vitality of china financing business
the thread owner shot from the hip , so i also talk nonsense to add to the fun
is overly bizarre !
indirectly known , indirect knowledge , indirect experience , indirect lesson etc , prophecy etc differences
why did n't the thread owner mention the fact of the nervous emotions among northeast asian countries before north korea researched and developed nuclear weapons ?
why did n't the thread owner be straightforward about what he wanted to say
i guess the north korea is short of supplies now , it needs those who have money to donate money , and those who have goods to donate goods .
among the united states , china , japan and korea , who will collaborate with north korea to raise the request for economic assistance ?
what happens if north korea did not have nuclear plans and nuclear facilities ?
north korea needed to be fed in its nuclear-free times , now with the nuclear plans and nuclear facilities , those who feed north korea has to feed them even better .
north korea said it will resume the six-party talks unconditionally .
north korea offered to resume the six-party talks earlier , which is just a conspiracy , but this conspiracy has such a bright appearance
therefore kim jong-il could only try every means to ask money from other countries
because russia understands that kim jong-il 's interpersonal integrity does n't have any morality .
russia embeds : once koreas have minor conflict , kim jong-il will cut natural gas , russia then will need to beg kim jong-il .
protecting north korea is protecting evil !
china has billions dollars of funding , how much does goldman sach having , how can they sell off china ?
this statement is a little not scientific
after reading the post , i feel that the thread poster b-tiger should first do some self-education
the best way to bluff is indirect bluffing
you go look for your daddy !
white tiger 's father is blue dragon ?
uncle is rose finch
let 's talk about it , what kind of rights do we have as taxpayers ?
hehe , it is true
the right to pay tax is a right after all
last year , first is creating the tianan vessel event , then chinese-japanese boat collision event .
however , very obviously , chinese diligently operated eastern alliance backyard , dissipated overnight .
the strategies of the united states never stop , but chinese diplomats only arrange chinese leaders to go for a visit , their abilities are limited and have nothing accomplished . there is no accountability system .
the intention of us encircling china is because china is getting rich and it has to make away china 's money and make china give in .
appoint your closest people .
great men 's sons seldom do well , makes a lot of sense .
united states united japan , australia and several small countries in the southeast formed a seal that does n't have any seam , operated many years , but also very easy to crack .
the united states has already completely contained china . the chinese people are doomed . cannot approve of this viewpoint !
it does n't matter , as long as the principal can survive
i have n't been here for a few day , it is the same situation here .
yesterday , there held a election for the village head on the back of the mountain .
i could afford another pack of cigarettes now .
inspected dozens of trucks
delivered to my mistress over night .
an idiot like your mistress deserves to be poor
i never take the normal road
i want to be rich too
becoming a eunuch can be rich !
commoners do hard work , ca n't eat well in the end .
commoners provide hard work , ca n't eat well in the end .
i am leaving
so in the year 48 screenplays were popular !
why is education unfair ?
those without capabilities mislead and harm young people
should they be paid such high salary ?
everyone has to fight corruption and remove the soil for corruption to grow , then the society can be clean and righteous
do n't wait to solve them one by one
it can . just see who is smarter than others
today i listened to the read newspapers every day by teacher du , teacher du 's point of view is it is able to do .
when it is too late , there wo n't be enough time .
they are opinions on public affairs .
what is the difference between the opinions from micro blogs and those from the print media ?
low key process is wise !
boring , discuss these are boring , criticizing traitors need to be public criticizing , in radio criticizing , but the radio is controlled by traitors
in one 's own personal microblog , to say a few strange worlds , have some complaints , curse some dirty words , is that allowed ?
this post will be abandoned again ?
what kind of speeches on earth should personal microblog be regarded ?
at this time , kong qingdong remained silent , because he knew that the three remarks were just grumbling in the microblog , which absolutely could not reflect his spirit connotation
but you yourself shit everywhere in this forum , have you reflected on yourself ?
or xiangjiang is enjoying your meal here all the time ?

blogger , also translated as web diary , or blog etc , is a type of website usually managed by an individual , posting new articles non - periodically .
reply 41 level 's scholar :
the result of encirclement , suppression , and blacklisting is deflecting to the negative side even more so !
he was famous originally ( but some people did not know that ) , however , some guys used eighty to three low-quality method to deliberately cook it up
speechless , what are you calculating within ?
agree for now !
a certain level ? it 's after reading this post and then creating another account , that 's a certain level
to add to that , they are born carefree , and has no intention to sink other people 's kids into disgrace .
now i can read , now i have said it .
when mentioning gdp , world 's number two , when mentioning helping the poor , already surpassed international standards ...
our goal for people is 7000 per person ? ...
for the people who know where is leaking of the roof are in universe , for the people who lost in election are in the field , for the people who know mistake are everybody
still giving out all this bullshit everyday , is that meaningful ?
from the currently exposed and historically exposed huge grafters in politics , they all had partnerships with capitals .
they could not fall into the abyss
certainly if those words are from someone considered the left , then i should be the right .
i believe all in the left around the world are with me .
external thieves are ultimately all internal thieves !
left and right , referring to the positioning of matters .
if you are positioned in the north facing south , left side would be east , right would be west .
close to the east side is considered leftist ...
the key difference between left and right is that the left says that everything was perfect in mao 's time . there was no corruption and no prostitution . everybody was equal and enthusiastic to work .
left wing break an opening , right wing follows in
then left and right strangle fight each other , use real ability to decide who becomes the boss .
from morning to night , when i have time i would chat on phoenix net .
chatting everything online , joyful than ever .
forum 's issues can be viewed as china 's issues abbreviated , of course even more so for the world , this is really a sea that has hundred ridges extending with no borders .
forum owner 's shells are hustling .
reply to 7th post above . currently , the worst thing on phoenix website is that it is totally messed up by those silly shameless people like you . but what can you do ?
do n't turn your face . you should find the right person for selling yourself .
do n't you afraid of damage to your disrepute ?
reply to the post on floor 22 , as long as out of sincerity , i welcome all without distinction . no offense was taken !
flattery makes me sick
he is way more honest than you , regarding intelligence you are even far worse
reply to the 50th post , you are an honest man , you do n't even understand some obvious things , of course it is ambiguous to you .
this forum is like a mirror , reflecting the two sides of humanity .
correcting typo , typed too fast , added a ( fake ) word .
apologize to floor owner and the media
like he said in reality there still are people having doubts about how everyone can become a talent , especially essential questions like what is talent .
it is printed , the people 's bank prints them according to how many products and service we provide to the americans . every one us dollars we make , we print 6.5 rmb , which is reimbursed to you from the new prints .
that 's right , everything 's in surplus , surplus means resources wasted .
those fools who lift stones to smash their own offspring are so laughable !
the intention of the american imperialists to destroy us has not died !
pollution is a technological problem , not a political problem .
if mao was expecting pollution he would not see it
if it is done reasonably and evidently , what you can do is to go off stage , you have no other choices .
not making good use of talents , how would a big nation survive ?
never able to grasp the key and basic work !
is this something can sacrifice the effectiveness of his job responsibilities and wait for the minister to grow up to be qualified ?
saints know the world without leaving home .
spend and waste recklessly
non-qualified workers and non-qualified government officials ,
sacrifice the important functionalities of important positions ,
they are not talented and not capable but they are all potential workers and officials .
the supreme nature law is extremely simple , well-off families are a result of a great country .
it is not easy to plant and raise a timber tree . it is bad not to use various kinds of timbers beneficially , lovingly and parsimoniously
only when talents and lumbers are correctly used at the gold time , can one achieve good results
various rules
flow in it , always flowing in circles on the surface and theories , even spent all day just
blindly sense and talk in it , this must be avoided !
people or timbers that are too mature and aging are a great waste and inefficient if used ,
all issues all boil down to one
without talents what causes and achievements can be achieved
in other words , the talents professional government officials are required to have are so much more than other professionals , requiring them to master
officials , publicly downgraded to
vulgar beyond belief / low interest/common sense errors etc historical jokes / international jokes etc
even a powerful person cannot defeat a local gangster .
national talents and national governmental officials
regional talents , officials
take a foreign student who is completely unfamiliar with chinese countryside and other side their major studies

look at you , even having the nerve to sell your ancestors . you still dare to discuss the national affairs , go and look up the surname of your ancestor first .
then two coast uniting issue is actually based on theoretically form uniting , theoretical form also is based on political structure and form basis , so the most important issue is still systematic regulation bias issues .
if you want to keep him to be your ancestor you go ahead keep it , nobody 's stopping you !
us giving up taiwan and re-establishing diplomatic relationship with mainland china is the best proof .
you do n't know the truth , you are not even clear about why the taiwan relations act is not forfeited for decades .
reply to 22nd floor 's post , these are residues left by the history , are waiting for me to enlighten !
this is even less solvable , think about it , in this case , foreigners reasoned , but chinese did n't reason .
let 's leave the legal reasoning aside , what do you mean by discrepancies between people across the strait ?
in reply to post #24 , international ?
solve our own problems ourselves . why should chinese people act in accordance with the will of the americans
they are just ordinary people only , because they ca n't escape being mundane , have high positions , but knowledge is only limited amount
you idiot cannot persuade any one . why do n't you devote yourself to the force , in order to be prepared for reunification by force
if we really ca n't save them all then we 'll just have to bury them on the spot , it 's all chinese people 's fault anyways !
of course it 's fine if you all ride on bikes .
mind your driving speed , mind your safety ...
beware of being cautious , think thrice before you act ?

during the long practice of new democratic revolution processes , mao zedong created the democratic discussion and decision-making principle of from the masses to the masses , fully reflected the democratic spirit

the united states only need one who pays its bill and follow it all the time to run errands
declaring it for over sixty years , compared to the world , the chinese people are getting poorer
the united states said that china , you cannot wake up , keep sleeping
good idea . the problem does not lie in china . if china and the united states can be hand in hand , it is a fortune of the world . but the united states did not think this way . what he wants is a housedog to guard his property
some politicians must realize it clearly that containment of china leads to a life-and-death struggle and a dead end
anti corruption advocated by the corrupted ones
win / overcome/rule with virtue
film and television 's negative influence on young people is that there are too many violent scenes , making it hard to develop an attitude that values life . this is what the media department need to control . the commercials in between two television episodes are trivial issues , there 's no need to do anything about it .
commercials give you time to go to the bathroom , why are n't you happy about that
violence in film and television can make a lot of profit !

in reply to post #6 le xie
of course i , every country has , but what does the patriot act have to do with collaborationists , traitors and moles
the us patriot act was signed by president george w bush into congressional law on october 26 2001 .
the dangerous thing about this act is that law enforcement is not transparent , it could easily be used as tools for fascists and racists .
traitor is not a legal term , instead , we use releasing confidential information or endangering national interest , these legal terms .
reputation infringement mainly has several following forms : insulting , slandering , revealing other people 's personal information .
it is the same at any period of any country
simple , two words : evil act
it has nothing to do with patriotism
simply put
as a respectful warning to the friends here , you do n't have to applaud for bush , the yob president , as soon as you see the word patriotism !
george w. bush also talks about patriotism !
uniting : unity , not quite .
sometimes laws are nonsense
*personal information
however , xiangjiang made a big mistake
so that post was abandoned half way
#57 besides the fact that you make a positive identification as a japanese pirate from the great east asia , i will now cite the classical comment by #56 on you : arduous and thankless wretched traitor !

2 . is it because cuba is very far from u.s ?
current constitution was passed in february 1976 , the constitution stipulates :
1959 january 1st , fidel castro led the rebellion army overthrown batista political power , constructed revolutionary government .
it is a fay sheep in their own sheepfold , the us could take care of cuba immediately .
cuba is by the side of us , it has suffered the economy blockage from us for over 50 years .
do you know any modern war that the us is not involved ?
the winners of world war ii called it the anti-fascist war .
go and do some research on the history of world war i and world war ii
of course it is rarely seen , deeper analytical articles have all been harmonized globally
just go trick retarded mao followers .
remember childhood there is a song : want cuba , want cuba , do n't want americans
it is a country who intended to lead the world , which was germany at that time
the main post pointed to the key point . this hangzhou is trying to seduce people to the sewer
if they find mobs smashing police cars , they will be killed together with their families in the us
the country that tries to lead the world is not going to start a war . if you destroy the world , who will you lead ? the world is messed up with war , how can you lead ?
secondly , they treat their own people and foreign people differently .
was it a weak or strong nation ?
